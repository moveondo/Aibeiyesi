ACCOUNTANTS’ REPORT

Exercise of warrants and option

In January 2016 and February 2016, certain warrants in connection with the convertible
promissory notes and short term notes were exercised to purchase 621,637 preferred shares, which
were converted into 621,637 ordinary shares. On the US IPO closing date, (i) the Company’s landlord
exercised its option to purchase 1,451,586 ordinary shares of the Company; (ii) Baker Bros. Advisors
LP. (“Baker Bros.”) exercised their warrants to purchase 2,592,593 ordinary shares at an exercise price
of US$0.68 per share; and (iii) a senior executive exercised warrants to purchase 57,777 preferred
shares at an exercise price of US$0.68 per share, which were converted into 57,777 ordinary shares.
Upon the exercise of the aforementioned option and warrants, except for Baker Bros.’ warrants, which
were initially classified in equity, the related carrying value totaling US$3,687,000 was reclassified
from current liabilities to shareholders’ equity.

31. RESTRICTED NET ASSETS

The Company’s ability to pay dividends may depend on the Company receiving distributions of
funds from its PRC subsidiaries. Relevant PRC statutory laws and regulations permit payments of
dividends by the Company’s PRC subsidiaries only out of its retained earnings, if any, as determined
in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. The results of operations reflected in
the consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with US GAAP differ from those
reflected in the statutory financial statements of the Company’s PRC subsidiaries.

In accordance with the company law of the PRC, a domestic enterprise is required to provide
statutory reserves of at least 10% of its annual after-tax profit until such reserve has reached 50% of
its respective registered capital based on the enterprise’s PRC statutory accounts. A domestic
enterprise is also required to provide discretionary surplus reserve, at the discretion of the Board of
Directors, from the profits determined in accordance with the enterprise’s PRC statutory accounts. The
aforementioned reserves can only be used for specific purposes and are not distributable as cash
dividends. The Company’s PRC subsidiaries were established as domestic enterprises and therefore
were subject to the above-mentioned restrictions on distributable profits.

During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2017 and the three months ended March 31, 2017
and 2018, no appropriation to statutory reserves was made because the PRC subsidiaries had
substantial losses during such periods.

As a result of these PRC laws and regulations including the requirement

to make annual
appropriations of at least 10% of after-tax income and set aside as general reserve fund prior to
payment of dividends, the Company’s PRC subsidiaries are restricted in their ability to transfer a
portion of their net assets to the Company.

Foreign exchange and other regulation in the PRC may further restrict the Company’s PRC
subsidiaries from transferring funds to the Company in the form of dividends, loans and advances. As
of December 31, 2016 and 2017 and March 31, 2018, amounts restricted are the net assets of the
Company’s PRC subsidiaries, which amounted to US$9,955,000, US$39,910,000 and US$37,036,000,
respectively.
