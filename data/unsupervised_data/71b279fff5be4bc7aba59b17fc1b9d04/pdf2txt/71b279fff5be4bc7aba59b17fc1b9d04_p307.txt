We are also required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in
subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from our estimates. We use historical data to estimate
pre-vesting option forfeitures and record share-based compensation expense only for those awards that
are expected to vest. To the extent that actual forfeitures differ from our estimates, the difference is
recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period the estimates were revised.
