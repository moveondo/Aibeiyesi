RISK FACTORS

•

•

•

•

•

•

ensuring we do not infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate the patent, trade secret or
other intellectual property rights of third parties;

successfully launching our drug candidates, if and when approved;

obtaining favorable reimbursement
approved;

competition with other products;

from third-party payors for drugs,

if and when

continued acceptable safety profile following regulatory approval; and

obtaining sufficient supplies of any competitor drug products that may be necessary for use
in clinical trials for evaluation of our drug candidates.

If we do not achieve one or more of these factors in a timely manner or at all, we could
experience significant delays in our ability or be unable to obtain approval for and/or to successfully
commercialize our drug candidates, which would materially harm our business and we may not be able
to generate sufficient revenues and cash flows to continue our operations.

If we encounter difficulties enrolling patients in our clinical trials, our clinical development
activities could be delayed or otherwise adversely affected.

The timely completion of clinical trials in accordance with their protocols depends, among other
its
things, on our ability to enroll a sufficient number of patients who remain in the trial until
conclusion. We may experience difficulties in patient enrollment in our clinical trials for a variety of
reasons, including the size and nature of the patient population and the patient eligibility criteria
defined in the protocol.

Our clinical trials will likely compete with other clinical trials for drug candidates that are in the
same therapeutic areas as our drug candidates, and this competition will reduce the number and types
of patients available to us, because some patients who might have opted to enroll in our trials may
instead opt to enroll in a trial being conducted by one of our competitors. Because the number of
qualified clinical investigators and clinical trial sites is limited, we expect to conduct some of our
clinical trials at the same clinical trial sites that some of our competitors use, which will reduce the
number of patients who are available for our clinical trials at such clinical trial sites. Even if we are
able to enroll a sufficient number of patients in our clinical trials, delays in patient enrollment may
result in increased costs or may affect the timing or outcome of the planned clinical trials, which could
prevent completion of these trials and adversely affect our ability to advance the development of our
drug candidates.
