value not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. An entity still has
the option to perform the qualitative assessment for a reporting unit to determine if the quantitative
impairment test is necessary. The amendments in this update are effective for goodwill impairment
tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted for goodwill
impairment tests performed after January 1, 2017. The Group elected to early adopt this ASU since
January 1, 2017, and there was no material impact on the Group’s consolidated financial statements.

In May 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-09, Compensation — Stock Compensation: Scope
of Modification Accounting. This standard provides clarity and reduces both (1) diversity in practice
and (2) cost and complexity when applying the guidance in Topic 718, Compensation-Stock
Compensation, to a change to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award. The updated
guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and early
adoption is permitted. The Group early adopted the updated guidance.

In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity
Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory, which requires the recognition of
the income tax
consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset, other than inventory, when the transfer occurs.
The Group early adopted ASU 2016-16 in preparing the Historical Financial Information. For public
business entities, the amendments in this update are effective for annual reporting periods beginning
after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within those annual reporting periods,
and early adoption is permitted. The Group early adopted the updated guidance.

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU No. 2014-09,
Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), or ASU 2014-09. Subsequently, the FASB issued
ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which adjusted the effective date
of ASU 2014-09; ASU No. 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal
versus Agent Considerations
the
principal-versus-agent implementation guidance and illustrations in ASU 2014-09; ASU No. 2016-10,
Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and
Licensing, which clarifies identifying performance obligations and licensing implementation guidance
and illustrations in ASU 2014-09; ASU No. 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic
606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients, which addresses implementation issues
and is intended to reduce the cost and complexity of applying the new revenue standard in ASU
2014-09; ASU No. 2017-13, Revenue Recognition (Topic 605), Revenue from Contracts with
Customers (Topic 606), Leases (Topic 840), and Leases (Topic 842): Amendments to SEC Paragraphs

Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220), Revenue Recognition (Topic 605), and
Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (SEC Update), which adds ASC 606-10-S25-1
as a result of SEC Release 33-10403, or collectively, the Revenue ASUs. The Revenue ASUs provide
an accounting standard for a single comprehensive model for use in accounting for revenue arising
from contracts with customers, and supersede most current revenue recognition guidance. The
accounting standard is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017,
with an option to early adopt for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The
guidance permits two methods of adoption: retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented

staff; and ASU No. 2017-14,
