Market Opportunity and Competition

A number of PD-1 or PD-L1 antibody drugs have been approved by the FDA. These include
Merck’s KEYTRUDA威 (pembrolizumab), Bristol-Myers Squibb’s OPDIVO威 (nivolumab), Roche’s
TECENTRIQ威 (atezolizumab), AstraZeneca’s IMFINZI威 (durvalumab) and Pfizer and Merck Sereno’s
BAVENCIO威 (avelumab). In the global setting, several PD-1 or PD-L1 antibody agents are in clinical
development besides us, such as Regeneron’s cemiplimab, Novartis’ PDR-001, Tesaro’s TSR042 and
Pfizer’s PF-06801591. According to the Frost & Sullivan Report, in 2017, global sales of the PD-1
class reached US$10.1 billion, which make some of these therapies among the best-selling and fastest
launched oncology drugs in history.

the worldwide mortalities from lung, gastric,

We believe there is a large commercial opportunity in China for PD-1 or PD-L1 antibody drugs.
Currently available clinical data suggest that some of the most prevalent cancers in China, such as
lung, gastric, liver and esophageal cancers, are responsive to this class of agents. In 2012, 38%, 45%,
51% and 49% of
liver and esophageal cancers,
respectively, occurred in China, according to the World Health Organization. Collectively, these four
tumor types comprised over 2.3 million new cases in 2016 in China alone, according to Chen et al.
2016. In addition, China has a higher proportion of PD-1 responsive tumors in its total annual cancer
incidence in comparison to other geographies like the United States and the European Union, or EU.
According to Chen et al. 2016, the annual incidence of the top 10 PD-1 responsive tumors in China
is estimated to be 3.0 million out of 4.3 million in total annual cancer incidence. In comparison, the
