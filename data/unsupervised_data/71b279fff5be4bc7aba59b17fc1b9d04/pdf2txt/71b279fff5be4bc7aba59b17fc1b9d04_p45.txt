FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

Certain statements in this prospectus are forward looking statements that are, by their nature,
subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Any statements that express, or involve discussions as
to, expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives, assumptions or future events or performance (often, but not
through the use of words or phrases such as “will”, “expect”, “anticipate”, “estimate”,
always,
“believe”, “going forward”, “ought
to”, “may”, “seek”, “should”, “intend”, “plan”, “projection”,
“could”, “vision”, “goals”, “aim”, “aspire”, “objective”, “target”, “schedules” and “outlook”) are not
historical facts, are forward-looking and may involve estimates and assumptions and are subject to
risks (including but not limited to the risk factors detailed in this prospectus), uncertainties and other
factors some of which are beyond our Company’s control and which are difficult
to predict.
Accordingly, these factors could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those
expressed in the forward-looking statements.

Our forward-looking statements have been based on assumptions and factors concerning future
events that may prove to be inaccurate. Those assumptions and factors are based on information
currently available to us about the businesses that we operate. The risks, uncertainties and other
factors, many of which are beyond our control, that could influence actual results include, but are not
limited to:

•

•

•

•

•

our operations and business prospects;

our business and operating strategies and our ability to implement such strategies;

our ability to develop and manage our operations and business;

our future general and administrative expenses;

competition for, among other things, capital, technology and skilled personnel;

our ability to control costs;

changes to regulatory and operating conditions in the industry and geographical markets in
which we operate; and

all other risks and uncertainties described in the section headed “Risk Factors” in this
prospectus.
