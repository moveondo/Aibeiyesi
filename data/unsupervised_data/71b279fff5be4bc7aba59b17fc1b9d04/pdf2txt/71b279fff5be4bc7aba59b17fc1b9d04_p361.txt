STRUCTURE OF THE GLOBAL OFFERING

Joint Global Coordinators. If the Hong Kong Offer Shares are notfully subscribed, the Joint Global
Coordinators have the authority to re-allocate all or any of the unsubscribed Hong Kong Offer Shares
to the International Placing in such number as it deems appropriate to satisfy the demand under the
International Placing. In addition to the allocation mentioned in the foregoing paragraph which may
be required, in the event (i) the International Placing is not fully subscribed; or (ii) the International
Placing is fully subscribed or oversubscribed and the Hong Kong Public Offering is fully subscribed
or oversubscribed with the number of Offer Shares validly applied for in the Hong Kong Public
Offering representing less than 12 times of the number of Offer Shares initially allocated for
subscription under the Hong Kong Public Offering, the Joint Global Coordinators have the authority
to re-allocate Offer Shares initially allocated for the International Offering to the Hong Kong Public
Offering in such number as it deems appropriate, provided that in accordance with Guidance Letter
HKEx-GL91-18 issued by the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, (i) the total number of Offer Shares
available under the Hong Kong Public Offering following such reallocation will be increased to
11,808,000 Shares, representing 18% of the total number of Offer Shares initially available under the
Global Offering (before any exercise of the Over-allotment Option), and the final Offer Price shall be
fixed at the low-end of the indicative Offer Price range (i.e. HK$94.40 per Offer Share) stated in this
prospectus. Details of any re-allocation of Offer Shares between the Hong Kong Public Offering and
the International Offering will be disclosed in the results announcement of the Hong Kong Public
Offering, which is expected to be published on Tuesday, August 7, 2018.

International Placing Shares under the International Placing.
