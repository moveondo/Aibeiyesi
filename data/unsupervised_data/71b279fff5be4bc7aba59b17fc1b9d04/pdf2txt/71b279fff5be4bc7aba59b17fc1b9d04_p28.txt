We have entered into collaborations, such as with Celgene and Merck KGaA, Darmstadt
Germany, and may form or seek collaborations or strategic alliances or enter into additional
licensing arrangements in the future, and we may not
realize the benefits of such
collaborations, alliances or licensing arrangements.

Our global collaboration with Celgene and the associated acquisition of Celgene’s
commercial operations in China could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition
if we are not able to successfully integrate the acquired business into ours, and the expected
benefits of the acquisition may not materialize.

Our future success depends on our ability to retain key executives and to attract, retain and
motivate qualified personnel.

We have significantly increased the size and capabilities of our organization, and we may
experience difficulties in managing our growth.

Changes in the political and economic policies of the PRC government may materially and
adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and may result
in our inability to sustain our growth and expansion strategies.
