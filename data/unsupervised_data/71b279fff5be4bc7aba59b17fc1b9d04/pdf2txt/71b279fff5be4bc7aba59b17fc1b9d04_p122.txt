WAIVERS FROM COMPLIANCE WITH THE LISTING RULES AND EXEMPTIONS FROM

THE COMPANIES (WINDING UP AND MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS) ORDINANCE

Paragraphs 4(4) and 4(5) of Appendix 3 provide that the minimum length of the period, during
which notice to the issuer of the intention to propose a person for election as a director and during
which notice to the issuer by such person of his willingness to be elected may be given, will be at least
7 days and the period for lodgment of the notices referred to above will commence no earlier than the
day after the despatch of the notice of the meeting appointed for such election and end no later than
7 days prior to the date of such meeting.

Comparable protection is provided as disclosed on page 31 of the Company’s Definitive Proxy
Statement filed with the SEC on April 30, 2018. As disclosed therein, any shareholder wishing to
recommend a director candidate for consideration by the Nominating and Corporate Governance
Committee should provide the following information within the timeframe set forth by the Articles and
Regulation 14A of the SEC rules and regulations: (a) the name and address of record of the
shareholder; (b) a representation that the shareholder is a record holder of the Company’s securities
or,
if the shareholder is not a record holder, evidence of ownership in accordance with Rule
14a-8(b)(2) of the Exchange Act; (c) the candidate’s name, age, business and residential address,
educational background, current principal occupation or employment, and principal occupation or
employment for the past five years; (d) a description of the qualifications and background of the
candidate that addresses the criteria for board membership approved by the Company’s board of
directors; (e) a description of all arrangements or understandings between the shareholder and the
candidate; (f) the consent of the candidate (i) to be named in the proxy statement for the Company’s
next shareholder meeting and (ii) to serve as a director if elected at that meeting; and (g) and any other
information regarding the candidate that is required to be included in a proxy statement filed pursuant
to SEC rules and regulations. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee may seek further
information from or about the shareholder making the recommendation, the candidate, or any such
other beneficial owner, including information about all business and other relationships between the
candidate and the shareholder and between the candidate and any such other beneficial owner. Rule
14a-11 requires shareholders to submit nominees no later than 120 days before the anniversary date
of the mailing of the company’s proxy statement for the prior year, far longer than the seven day
requirement in the Articles Requirements. The Company is also prepared to undertake to amend its
Articles to reflect the Articles Requirements should it cease to be subject to section 14A of the
Exchange Act and the corresponding SEC rules and regulations.

As regards accounts

Paragraph 5 of Appendix 3 provides that a copy of either (a) the directors’ report, accompanied
by the balance sheet (including every document required by law to be annexed thereto) and profit and
loss account or income and expenditure account, or (b) the summary financial report shall, at least 21
days before the date of the general meeting, be delivered or sent by post to the registered address of
every member. Paragraph 4(2) of Part B of Appendix 13 provides that the articles of association shall
require the issuer to keep proper books of account necessary to give a true and fair view of the issuer’s
affairs, and shall provide that accounts shall be audited and shall be laid before members at the annual
general meeting which must be held in each year; not more than 15 months (or such longer period as
the Exchange may authorise) may elapse between the date of one annual general meeting and the next.
