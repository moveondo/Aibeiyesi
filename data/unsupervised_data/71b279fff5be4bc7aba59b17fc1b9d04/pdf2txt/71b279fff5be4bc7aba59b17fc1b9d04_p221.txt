Other Lymphomas

On December 9, 2017, we presented additional data from our Phase 1 trial at the 59th American
Society of Hematology, or ASH, Annual Meeting in Atlanta, GA. This dataset included 34 patients in
an indolent lymphoma cohort, which consisted of 24 patients with FL and 10 patients with MZL, and
65 patients in an aggressive lymphoma cohort, which consisted of 27 patients with diffuse large B-cell
lymphoma, or DLBCL, and 38 patients with MCL. The median follow-up time was 5.6 months
(0.3—22.3 months) and 5.1 months (0.1—31.9) for indolent and aggressive lymphoma, respectively.

As of the data cutoff of September 15, 2017, the most frequent AEs (occurring in ≥15% of
patients)
were
petechiae/purpura/contusion (24%), upper respiratory tract infection (21%), nausea (18%) and pyrexia
(15%). The most frequently reported grade 3 or greater AEs (occurring in ≥5% of patients) of any
attribution were anemia (9%), neutropenia (9%), urinary tract infection (6%) and abdominal pain
(6%). SAEs were reported in 11 patients (32%). Of those, four patients had SAEs that were considered
possibly related to zanubrutinib, including one case each of nausea, urinary tract infection, diarrhea
and creatinine increase.

The most frequent AEs (occurring in ≥15% of patients) of any attribution among 65 patients with
aggressive lymphoma were petechiae/purpura/contusion (25%), diarrhea (23%), constipation (22%),
fatigue (18%), upper respiratory tract infection (18%), anemia (17%), cough (15%), pyrexia (15%) and
thrombocytopenia (15%). The most frequently reported grade 3 or greater AEs (occurring in ≥ 5% of
patients) of any attribution were anemia (11%), neutropenia (9%),
thrombocytopenia (9%) and
pneumonia (6%). SAEs were reported in 26 patients (40%). Of those, three patients had SAEs that
were considered possibly related to zanubrutinib, including one case each of peripheral edema and
joint effusion (occurring in the same patient), pneumonia and pneumonitis.

At the time of data cutoff, 26 patients with indolent lymphoma, including 17 patients with FL
and nine patients with MZL, were evaluable for efficacy. In patients with FL, the ORR was 41%, with
CRs in 18% and PRs in 24% of patients. SD was observed in 41% of patients. Progressive disease was
observed in one patient. In patients with MZL, the ORR was 78%, with no CRs and PRs in 78% of
patients. SD was observed in 22% of patients. No progressive disease was observed.

58 patients with aggressive lymphoma, including 26 patients with DLBCL and 32 patients with
MCL, were evaluable for efficacy. In patients with DLBCL, the ORR was 31%, with CRs in 15% and
PRs in 15% of patients. In patients with MCL, the ORR was 88%, with CRs in 25% and PRs in 63%
of patients.
