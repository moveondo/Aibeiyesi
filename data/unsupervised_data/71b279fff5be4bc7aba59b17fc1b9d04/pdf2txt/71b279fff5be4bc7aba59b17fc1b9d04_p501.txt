APPENDIX III

Special Resolutions

SUMMARY OF THE CONSTITUTION OF THE
COMPANY AND CAYMAN COMPANIES LAW

The Cayman Companies Law provides that a resolution is a special resolution when it has been
passed by a majority of at least two-thirds of such members as, being entitled to do so, vote in person
or, where proxies are allowed, by proxy at a general meeting of which notice specifying the intention
to propose the resolution as a special resolution has been duly given, except that a company may in
its articles of association specify that the required majority shall be a number greater than two-thirds,
and may additionally so provide that such majority (being not less than two-thirds) may differ as
between matters required to be approved by a special resolution. Written resolutions signed by all the
members entitled to vote for the time being of the company may take effect as special resolutions if
this is authorized by the articles of association of the company.

Subsidiary Owning Shares in Parent

The Companies Law does not prohibit a Cayman Islands company acquiring and holding shares
in its parent company provided its objects so permit. The directors of any subsidiary making such
acquisition must discharge their duties of care and to act in good faith, for a proper purpose and in
the interests of the subsidiary.

Mergers and Similar Arrangements

The Companies Law permits mergers and consolidations between Cayman Islands companies and

between Cayman Islands companies and non-Cayman Islands companies.

For these purposes, (1) “merger” means the merging of two or more constituent companies and
the vesting of their undertaking, property and liabilities in one of such companies as the surviving
company, and (2) a “consolidation” means the combination of two or more constituent companies into
a consolidated company and the vesting of the undertaking, property and liabilities of such companies
to the consolidated company. In order to effect such a merger or consolidation, the directors of each
constituent company must approve a written plan of merger or consolidation, which must then be
authorised by (1) a special resolution of the shareholders of each constituent company, and (2) such
other authorisation, if any, as may be specified in such constituent company’s articles of association.
The plan must be filed with the Registrar of Companies together with a declaration as to the solvency
of the consolidated or surviving company, a list of the assets and liabilities of each constituent
company and an undertaking that a copy of the certificate of merger or consolidation will be given to
the members and creditors of each constituent company and that notification of the merger or
consolidation will be published in the Cayman Islands Gazette. Court approval is not required for a
merger or consolidation effected in compliance with these statutory procedures.

In addition, there are statutory provisions that facilitate the reconstruction and amalgamation of
companies, provided that the arrangement is approved by a majority in number of each class of
shareholders and creditors with whom the arrangement is to be made, and who must, in addition,
represent three-fourths in value of each such class of shareholders or creditors, as the case may be,
that are present and voting either in person or by proxy at a meeting, or meetings, convened for that
