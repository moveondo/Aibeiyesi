RISK FACTORS

future success of that drug candidate to the third party. For any drugs or drug candidates that we may
seek to in-license from third parties, we may face significant competition from other pharmaceutical
or biotechnology companies with greater resources or capabilities than us, and any agreement that we
do enter may result in the anticipated benefits.

Further, collaborations involving our drugs and drug candidates are subject to numerous risks,

which may include the following:

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

collaborators have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they
will apply to a collaboration;

collaborators may not pursue development and commercialization of our drug candidates or
may elect not to continue or renew development or commercialization programs based on
clinical trial results, changes in their strategic focus due to the acquisition of competitive
drugs, availability of funding, or other external factors, such as a business combination that
diverts resources or creates competing priorities;

collaborators may delay clinical trials, provide insufficient funding for a clinical trial, stop
a clinical trial, abandon a drug candidate, repeat or conduct new clinical trials, or require
a new formulation of a drug candidate for clinical testing;

collaborators could independently develop, or develop with third parties, drugs that
compete directly or indirectly with our drugs or drug candidates;

a collaborator with marketing and distribution rights to one or more drugs may not commit
sufficient resources to their marketing and distribution;

collaborators may not properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights or may
use our intellectual property or proprietary information in a way that gives rise to actual or
threatened litigation that could jeopardize or
intellectual property or
proprietary information or expose us to potential liability;

invalidate our

disputes may arise between us and a collaborator that cause the delay or termination of the
research, development or commercialization of our drug candidates, or that result in costly
litigation or arbitration that diverts management attention and resources;

collaborations may be terminated and, if terminated, may result in a need for additional
capital
the applicable drug
candidates; and

to pursue further development or commercialization of

collaborators may own or co-own intellectual property covering our drugs that results from
our collaborating with them, and in such cases, we would not have the exclusive right to
commercialize such intellectual property.
