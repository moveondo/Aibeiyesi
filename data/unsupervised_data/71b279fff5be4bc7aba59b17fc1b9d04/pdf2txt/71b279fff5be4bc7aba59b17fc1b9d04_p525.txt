APPENDIX IV

STATUTORY AND GENERAL INFORMATION

All employees of our Company and participating subsidiaries who have completed at least six
months of employment at the beginning of each offering period are eligible to participate in the 2018
ESPP, other than employees who would own 5% or more of the voting power of our Shares after
exercising their rights to purchase shares under the 2018 ESPP.

To participate in the 2018 ESPP, an eligible employee authorizes payroll deductions in an amount
not less than 1% nor greater than 10% of his or her “eligible earnings” (i.e., gross cash compensation,
including regular base pay (including overtime pay and commissions, to the extent determined by our
compensation committee), but excluding incentive or bonus awards, allowances and reimbursements
for expenses such as relocation allowances or travel expenses, income or gain on the exercise of share
options, and similar items) for each full payroll period in the offering period.

Eligible employees enroll in an offering period (which generally will begin on each March 1 and
September 1 and last for six months unless otherwise determined by our compensation committee in
advance) during the open enrollment period prior to the start of that offering period. The first offering
period, if the 2018 ESPP is approved, is expected to begin on September 4, 2018 and last until
February 28, 2019. Shares are purchased at a price equal to 85% of the fair market value of our
ordinary shares on either the first local business day of the offering period or the last local business
day of the offering period, whichever is lower.

If a participating employee voluntarily resigns or is terminated by us prior to the last day of an
offering period, the employee’s option to purchase terminates and the cash amount in the employee’s
account is returned to the employee.

In the event of a recapitalization, reclassification, share split, reverse split, combination of
shares, exchange of shares, share dividend, or similar event, the number and kind of shares that may
be purchased under the 2018 ESPP will be adjusted proportionately such that the proportionate interest
of participating employees remains the same, to the extent practicable. In the event of a change in
control, each outstanding option will be assumed or an equivalent option will be substituted. In the
event outstanding options are not assumed or substituted, the offering period with respect to which
such outstanding option relates will be shortened by setting a new exercise date prior to the date of
the change in control.
