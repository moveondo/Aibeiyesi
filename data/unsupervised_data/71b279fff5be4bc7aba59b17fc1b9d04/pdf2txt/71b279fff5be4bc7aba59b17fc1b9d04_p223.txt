qualified as a dose-limiting toxicity, or DLT. These events were not associated with a positive direct
antiglobulin test and were resolved with immunosuppressive therapy, but resulted in the decision to
exclude further enrollment of WM patients in the trial. As of the data cutoff date, this autoimmune
hemolysis is the only DLT case that was observed.

Among patients with indolent lymphoma, the most common AEs (occurring in ≥ 20% of patients)
of any attribution were petechiae/purpura/contusion (31%) and thrombocytopenia (23%). Grade 3 and
4 AEs of any attribution reported in at least two patients included thrombocytopenia, anemia and
hemolysis (15% each). In addition to the two cases of autoimmune hemolysis, there was one more
immune-related event, a grade 4 autoimmune encephalitis. The patient was treated with aggressive
immunosuppressive therapy and gradually improved over time.

Among patients with aggressive lymphoma,

the most common AEs (occurring in ≥ 20% of
patients) of any attribution were diarrhea, fatigue, pyrexia, upper respiratory tract infection (33%
each), cough (25%) and nausea (25%). Grade 3 and 4 AEs of any attribution reported in at least two
patients included pyrexia (17%). There was one patient with multiple occurrences of grade 2 and 3
pneumonitis.

In addition, certain IRAEs may be associated with checkpoint inhibition and the combination of

checkpoint inhibitors with other drugs.

At the time of data cutoff, the efficacy-evaluable population consisted of 25 patients. Objective
responses were observed in 10 patients (40%). By tumor type, two PRs were observed out of five
patients with CLL, one CR and one PR were observed out of five patients with FL, one VGPR and one
minor response were observed out of two patients with WM, one CR was observed out of five patients
with DLBCL, and three PRs were observed out of five patients with transformed lymphoma.

Pooled Analysis of Safety Data from Monotherapy Trials

We presented at the 2018 EHA meeting the pooled safety data from patients with various B-cell
lymphomas in four ongoing zanubrutinib monotherapy studies, totaling 476 patients with a median
exposure of seven months. Overall, the data suggest that exposure levels of zanubrutinib resulting in
complete and sustained BTK inhibition can be achieved and that zanubrutinib was generally
well-tolerated. There are infrequent events of interest with BTK inhibitor therapy, such as atrial
fibrillation/flutter (2%), major hemorrhage (2%), and grade 3 and above diarrhea (1%). Treatment
discontinuation due to zanubrutinib-related AEs was uncommon (3%). The majority of patients (94%)
experienced one or more AE of any attribution, primarily grades 1 or 2. The most common grade 3
or higher AEs of any attribution were neutropenia/neutrophil count decreased/febrile neutropenia
(14%), anemia (7%) and thrombocytopenia/platelet count decreased (7%). SAEs were reported in 116
patients (24%), with 38 patients (8%) assessed by the investigator as related to zanubrutinib. The most
common SAEs were pneumonia/lung infection (6%), pleural effusion (1%), and febrile neutropenia
(1%). The only treatment-related SAE reported in greater than 1% of patients was pneumonia/lung
infection (2%). No cases of pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PJP) or cytomegalovirus (CMV)
included
reactivation were
petechiae/purpura/contusion (26%)
