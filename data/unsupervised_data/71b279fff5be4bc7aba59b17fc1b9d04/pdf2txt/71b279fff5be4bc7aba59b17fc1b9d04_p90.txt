RISK FACTORS

•

•

•

retention of key employees, the loss of key personnel, and uncertainties in our ability to
maintain key business relationships;

risks and uncertainties associated with the other party to such a transaction, including the
prospects of that party and their existing drugs or drug candidates and regulatory approvals;
and

our inability to generate revenue from acquired technology and/or products sufficient to
meet our objectives in undertaking the acquisition or even to offset
the associated
acquisition and maintenance costs.

In addition, if we undertake acquisitions, we may issue dilutive securities, assume or incur debt
obligations, incur large one-time expenses and acquire intangible assets that could result in significant
future amortization expense.

PRC regulations and rules concerning mergers and acquisitions, including the Regulations on
Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Companies by Foreign Investors (《關於外國投資者併購境內
企業的規定》), or the M&A Rules, and other recently adopted regulations and rules with respect to
mergers and acquisitions established additional procedures and requirements that could make merger
and acquisition activities by foreign investors more time consuming and complex. For example, the
M&A Rules require that the MOFCOM, be notified in advance of any change-of-control transaction
in which a foreign investor takes control of a PRC domestic enterprise, if (i) any important industry
is concerned, (ii) such transaction involves factors that have or may have impact on the national
economic security, or (iii) such transaction will lead to a change in control of a domestic enterprise
which holds a famous
trademark or PRC time-honored brand. Moreover, according to the
Anti-Monopoly Law of PRC (《中華人民共和國反龔斷法》) and the Provisions on Thresholds for Prior
Notification of Concentrations of Undertakings, or the Prior Notification Rules issued by the State
Council, the concentration of business undertakings by way of mergers, acquisitions or contractual
arrangements that allow one market player to take control of or to exert decisive impact on another
market player must also be notified in advance to the SAMR when the threshold is crossed and such
concentration shall not be implemented without the clearance of prior notification. In addition, the
Regulations on Implementation of Security Review System for the Merger and Acquisition of
Domestic Enterprise by Foreign Investors (《實施外國投資者併購境內企業安全審查制度的規定》), or
the Security Review Rules, issued by the MOFCOM specify that mergers and acquisitions by foreign
investors that raise “national defense and security” concerns and mergers and acquisitions through
which foreign investors may acquire the de facto control over domestic enterprises that raise “national
security” concerns are subject to strict review by the MOFCOM, and the rules prohibit any activities
attempting to bypass a security review by structuring the transaction through, among other things,
trusts, entrustment or contractual control arrangements. In the future, we may grow our business by
acquiring complementary businesses. Complying with the requirements of the above-mentioned
regulations and other relevant rules to complete such transactions could be time consuming, and any
required approval processes, including obtaining approval from the SAMR, the MOFCOM or its local
counterparts may delay or inhibit our ability to complete such transactions. It is unclear whether our
business would be deemed to be in an industry that raises “national defense and security” or “national
security” concerns. However, the MOFCOM or other government agencies may publish explanations
in the future determining that our business is in an industry subject to the security review, in which
