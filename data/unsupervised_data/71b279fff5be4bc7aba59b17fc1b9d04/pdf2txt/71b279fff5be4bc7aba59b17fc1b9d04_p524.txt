2018 ESPP

Summary

The Company will not issue any options under the 2018 ESPP, which was approved by the Board
on June 6, 2018, until the 2018 ESPP is amended to comply with Chapter 17 of the Listing Rules. The
Board is permitted to make the necessary amendments to the 2018 ESPP under the terms of such plan
to comply with Chapter 17 of the Listing Rules and expects to make such amendments prior to
completion of the Global Offering, following which the principal terms of the 2018 ESPP are expected
to be as described below. Initially 3,500,000 ordinary shares of our Company are reserved for issuance
under the 2018 ESPP. In addition, on January 1, 2019 and each January 1 thereafter through January
1, 2028, the number of Shares reserved and available for issuance under the 2018 ESPP will be
cumulatively increased by the least of (i) 5,000,000 Shares, (ii) 0.5% of the number of Shares issued
and outstanding on the immediately preceding December 31, or (iii) such lesser number of Shares as
determined by our compensation committee; provided that the aggregate number of options available
for issuance under the 2018 ESPP and our other Equity Plans may not represent in excess of 10% of
the number of Shares issued and outstanding as of the date of approval.

The 2018 ESPP allows eligible employees to purchase our Shares (including in the form of
ADSs) at a 15% discount to the market price of our Shares or ADSs. Employees would purchase our
Shares or ADSs at the end of an offering period using funds deducted from their payroll during the
offering period.

The 2018 ESPP is administered under the direction of our compensation committee, which has
authority to interpret the provisions of the 2018 ESPP and to make all other determinations necessary
or advisable in administering it.
