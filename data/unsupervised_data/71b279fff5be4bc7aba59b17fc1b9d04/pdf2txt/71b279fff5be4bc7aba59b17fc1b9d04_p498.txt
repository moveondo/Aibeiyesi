APPENDIX III

Share Capital

SUMMARY OF THE CONSTITUTION OF THE
COMPANY AND CAYMAN COMPANIES LAW

The Companies Law permits a company to issue ordinary shares, preference shares, redeemable

shares or any combination thereof.

The Companies Law provides that where a company issues shares at a premium, whether for cash
or otherwise, a sum equal to the aggregate amount of the value of the share premium on those shares
shall be transferred to an account called the “share premium account”. At the option of a company,
these provisions may not apply to share premium on shares of that company allotted pursuant to any
arrangement in consideration of the acquisition or cancellation of shares in any other company and
issued at a premium. The Companies Law provides that the share premium account may be applied by
a company, subject to the provisions, if any, of its memorandum and articles of association, in such
manner as the company may from time to time determine including, but without limitation:

(a)

paying distributions or dividends to members;

(b)

(c)

paying up unissued shares of the company to be issued to members as fully paid bonus
shares;

in the redemption and repurchase of shares (subject to the provisions of section 37 of the
Companies Law);

(d) writing-off the preliminary expenses of the company;

(e) writing-off the expenses of, or the commission paid or discount allowed on, any issue of

shares or debentures of the company; and

(f)

providing for the premium payable on redemption or purchase of any shares or debentures
of the company.

No distribution or dividend may be paid to members out of the share premium account unless
immediately following the date on which the distribution or dividend is proposed to be paid the
company will be able to pay its debts as they fall due in the ordinary course of business.

The Companies Law provides that, subject to confirmation by the Grand Court of the Cayman
Islands, a company limited by shares or a company limited by guarantee and having a share capital
may, if so authorised by its articles of association, by special resolution reduce its share capital in any
way.

Subject to the detailed provisions of the Companies Law, a company limited by shares or a
company limited by guarantee and having a share capital may, if so authorised by its articles of
association, issue shares which are to be redeemed or are liable to be redeemed at the option of the
company or a shareholder. In addition, such a company may, if authorised to do so by its articles of
association, purchase its own shares, including any redeemable shares. The manner of such a purchase
must be authorised either by the articles of association or by an ordinary resolution of the company.
