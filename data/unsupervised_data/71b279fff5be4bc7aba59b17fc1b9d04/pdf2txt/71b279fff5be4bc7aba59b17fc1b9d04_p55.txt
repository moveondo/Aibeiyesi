RISK FACTORS

immune-mediated pneumonitis, colitis, hepatitis, endocrinopathies, nephritis and renal dysfunction,
skin adverse reactions, and encephalitis. These IRAEs may be more common in certain patient
populations (potentially including elderly patients) and may be exacerbated when checkpoint
inhibitors are combined with other therapies.

Additionally, undesirable side effects caused by our drugs and drug candidates, or caused by our
drugs and drug candidates when used in combination with other drugs, could potentially cause
significant negative consequences, including:

•

•

•

•

•

•

regulatory authorities could delay or halt pending clinical trials;

we may suspend, delay or alter development of the drug candidate or marketing of the drug;

regulatory authorities may withdraw approvals or revoke licenses of the drug, or we may
determine to do so even if not required;

regulatory authorities may require additional warnings on the label;

we may be required to develop a Risk Evaluation Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, for the
drug, as is the case with REVLIMID威, or, if a REMS is already in place, to incorporate
additional requirements under the REMS, or to develop a similar strategy as required by a
comparable regulatory authority;

we may be required to conduct post-market studies; and

we could be sued and held liable for harm caused to subjects or patients.

Any of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the
particular drug or drug candidate, and could significantly harm our business, results of operations and
prospects.

Our drugs and any future approved drug candidates will be subject to ongoing regulatory
obligations and continued regulatory review, which may result in significant additional expense
and we may be subject to penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or
experience unanticipated problems with our drug candidates.

Our drugs and any additional drug candidates that are approved are and will be subject

to
ongoing regulatory requirements
storage, advertising,
promotion, sampling, record-keeping, conduct of post-marketing studies, and submission of safety,
efficacy, and other post-market information, including both federal and state requirements in the
United States and requirements of comparable regulatory authorities in China and other countries.

Manufacturers and manufacturers’ facilities are required to comply with extensive FDA, CDA,
EMA and comparable regulatory authority requirements, including, in the United States, ensuring that
quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to cGMP regulations. As such, we and our
contract manufacturers are and will be subject
