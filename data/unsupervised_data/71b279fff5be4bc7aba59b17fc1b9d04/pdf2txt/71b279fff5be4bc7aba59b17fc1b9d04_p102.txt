RISK FACTORS

is a resident enterprise for PRC enterprise income tax purposes, a number of unfavorable PRC tax
consequences could follow and we may be subject to enterprise income tax at a rate of 25% on our
worldwide taxable income, as well as to PRC enterprise income tax reporting obligations. If we are
deemed a PRC resident enterprise, dividends paid on our ordinary shares or ADSs, and any gain
realized from the transfer of our ordinary shares or ADSs, may be treated as income derived from
sources within the PRC. As a result, dividends paid to non-PRC resident enterprise ADS holders or
shareholders may be subject to PRC withholding tax at a rate of 10% (or 20% in the case of non-PRC
individual ADS holders or shareholders) and gains realized by non-PRC resident enterprises ADS
holders or shareholders from the transfer of our ordinary shares or ADSs may be subject to PRC tax
at a rate of 10% (or 20% in the case of non-PRC individual ADS holders or shareholders).

We and our shareholders face uncertainties with respect to indirect transfers of equity interests
in PRC resident enterprises or other assets attributed to a PRC establishment of a non-PRC
company, or other assets attributable to a PRC establishment of a non-PRC company.

Pursuant to the Bulletin on Issues of Enterprise Income Tax and Indirect Transfers of Assets by
Non-PRC Resident Enterprises (《關於非居民企業間接轉讓財產企業所得稅若干問題的公告》), or
Bulletin 7, which was amended by the Announcement on Issues Relating to Withholding at Source of
Income Tax of Non-resident Enterprises issued by SAT (《關於非居民企業所得稅源泉扣繳有關問題的
公告》), or Announcement 37, an “indirect transfer” of “PRC taxable assets,” including equity interests
in a PRC resident enterprise, by non-PRC resident enterprises may be recharacterized and treated as
a direct transfer of PRC taxable assets, if such arrangement does not have a reasonable commercial
purpose and was established for the purpose of avoiding payment of PRC enterprise income tax. As
a result, gains derived from such indirect transfer may be subject to PRC enterprise income tax. When
determining whether there is a “reasonable commercial purpose” of the transaction arrangement,
factors to be taken into consideration include: whether the main value of the equity interest of the
relevant offshore enterprise derives from PRC taxable assets; whether the assets of the relevant
offshore enterprise mainly consists of direct or indirect investment in the PRC or if its income mainly
derives from the PRC; whether the offshore enterprise and its subsidiaries directly or indirectly
holding PRC taxable assets have real commercial nature which is evidenced by their actual function
and risk exposure; the duration of existence of the business model and organizational structure; the
replicability of the transaction by direct transfer of PRC taxable assets; and the tax situation of such
indirect transfer and applicable tax treaties or similar arrangements. In respect of an indirect offshore
transfer of assets of a PRC establishment, the resulting gain is to be reported on with the enterprise
income tax filing of the PRC establishment or place of business being transferred, and would
consequently be subject to PRC enterprise income tax at a rate of 25%. Where the underlying transfer
relates to equity investments in a PRC resident enterprise, which is not related to a PRC establishment
or place of business of a non-resident enterprise, a PRC enterprise income tax at the rate of 10% would
apply, subject
tax treatment under applicable tax treaties or similar
arrangements. Late payment of applicable tax will subject the transferor to default interest. Gains
derived from the sale of shares by investors through a public stock exchange are not subject to the PRC
enterprise income tax pursuant to Bulletin 7 where such shares were acquired in a transaction through
a public stock exchange. As such, the sale of the ADSs or ordinary shares on a public stock exchange
will not be subject to PRC enterprise income tax pursuant to Bulletin 7. However, the sale of our
ordinary shares or ADSs by a non-PRC resident enterprise outside a public stock exchange may be
subject to PRC enterprise income tax under Bulletin 7.
