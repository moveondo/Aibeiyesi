ACCOUNTANTS’ REPORT

(the full retrospective method), or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the
guidance recognized at the date of initial application (the modified retrospective method). The Group
early adopted the new standard for accounting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 under full
retrospective method in the preparing the Historical Financial Information.

The Group has not adopted the following accounting pronouncements that have been issued but

not yet effective:

In February 2016,

the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases, which requires lessees to
recognize right-of-use assets and future lease liabilities in respest of lease arrangements longer than
12 months on the balance sheet. This standard also requires additional disclosures by lessees and
contains targeted changes to accounting by lessors. The updated guidance is effective for interim and
annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and early adoption is permitted. As at March 31,
2018, the Group had non-cancellable operating lease commitments of US$32,879,000 as disclosed in
note II.33. The Group is in the process of evaluating its leasing arrangements to determine what extent
these contractual commitments will affect
the recognition of the related right-of-use assets and
liabilities for future lease payments in the consolidated balance sheet. Some of such commitments
under short term leases may be exempted from the recognition of relevant assets or liabilities under
ASU 2016-02. The Group does not expect that the adoption of ASU 2016-02 will result in significant
impact on the operating performance, cash flows and net assets of the Group, but does expect that a
certain portion of these operating lease commitments will be required to be recognized on the balance
sheet as right-of-use assets and lease liabilities under ASU 2016-02.
