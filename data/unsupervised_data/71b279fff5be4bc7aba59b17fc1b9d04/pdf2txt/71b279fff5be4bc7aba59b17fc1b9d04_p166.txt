Japan and EU5 (United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy and Spain) data are from 2015 (GLOBOCAN); China data
is from 2015 (Chen et al.), U.S. data is from 2017 (SEER program), the Frost & Sullivan analysis.

The diagram below illustrates the methodology Frost & Sullivan used to calculate incidence of

PD-1/PD-L1 responsive tumors in each of the four regions in the diagram above.

      There  are  2  global  approved  anti-PD-1  antibodies:  Opdivo®  and 
√ 
Keytruda®  and  3  globally  approved  anti-PD-L1  antibodies: 
TECENTRIQ®, IMFINZI® and BAVENCIO®.

      The PD-1/PD-L1 responsive tumors could be broadly categorized as 
√ 
approved  indications  and  tumors  with  positive  late  stage  clinical 
data.  These  include  melanoma,  lung  cancer,  liver  cancer,  gastric 
cancer,  renal  cancer,  urothelial  carcinoma,  esophagus  cancer, 
Hodgkin’s  lymphoma,  lip  and  oral  cancer,  cervical  cancer,  and 
larynx cancer, Merkel cell carcinoma, head and neck squamous cell 
carcinoma,  primary  mediastinal  large  B-cell  lymphoma,  MSI-h 
colorectal cancer, and other MSI-h cancers.
