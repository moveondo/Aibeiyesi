Reallocation and Clawback

The allocation of the Offer Shares between the Hong Kong Public Offering and the International
Placing is subject to reallocation. We have applied to the Stock Exchange for, and the Stock Exchange
has granted us, a waiver from strict compliance with Paragraph 4.2 of Practice Note 18 to the Listing
Rules such that,
the alternative clawback mechanism shall be
subscription tranche depending on the demand for those shares as set out in the paragraph. We have
applied to the Stock Exchange for, and the Stock Exchange has granted us, a waiver from strict
compliance with Paragraph 4.2 of Practice Note 18 to the Listing Rules such that, in the event of
over-subscription, the alternative clawback mechanism shall be applied

in the event of over-subscription,

The allocation of Shares between the Hong Kong Public Offering and the International Placing
is subject to adjustment. If the number of Shares validly applied for in the Hong Kong Public Offering
represents (i) 12 times or more but less than 40 times, (ii) 40 times or more but less than 85 times,
and (iii) 85 times or more, of the number of Hong Kong Offer Shares initially available under the Hong

Public Offering will be increased to 8,528,000, 11,152,000 and 21,648,000 Shares, respectively,
representing approximately 13% (in the case of (i)), 17% (in the case of (ii)) and 33% (in the case of
(iii)), respectively, of the total number of Offer Shares initially available under the Global Offering
(before any exercise of the Over-allotment Option), reallocation being referred to in this prospectus
as “Mandatory Reallocation”. In such cases, the number of Offer Shares allocated in the International
Placing will be correspondingly reduced, in such manner as the Joint Global Coordinators and the
Joint Sponsors deem appropriate, and such additional Offer Shares will be reallocated to Pool A and
Pool B. If the Hong Kong Offer Shares are not fully subscribed, the Joint Global Coordinators have

Placing, in such proportions as the Joint Global Coordinators and the Joint Sponsors deem appropriate.
In addition to any Mandatory Reallocation which may be required, the Joint Global Coordinators and
the Joint Sponsors may, at their discretion, reallocate Shares initially allocated for the International
Placing to the Hong Kong Public Offering to satisfy valid applications in Pool A and Pool B under the
Hong Kong Public Offering, regardless of whether the Mandatory Reallocation is triggered.

The Offer Shares to be offered in the Hong Kong Public Offering and the International Placing
may, in certain circumstances, be allocated as between these offerings at the sole discretion of the
