WAIVERS FROM COMPLIANCE WITH THE LISTING RULES AND EXEMPTIONS FROM

THE COMPANIES (WINDING UP AND MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS) ORDINANCE

in its Articles should not detract from the level of shareholder protection. We have therefore applied
for, and the Stock Exchange has agreed to grant, a waiver from the requirement set out in Paragraph
11(1) of Appendix 3 for the reasons set out above.

As regards voting

Paragraph 14 of Appendix 3 provides that where any shareholder is, under Listing Rules,
required to abstain from voting on any particular resolution or restricted to voting only for or only
against any particular resolution, any votes cast by or on behalf of such shareholder in contravention
of such requirement or restriction shall not be counted. To the extent that a transaction would require
a shareholder to abstain from voting pursuant to the Listing Rules, the Company has undertaken to the
Stock Exchange that it will not proceed with a transaction unless the votes required to approve a
transaction would have been reached without counting the votes of the shareholder that ought to have
been required to abstain. On the basis that we have given an undertaking to the Stock Exchange to put
in place alternative measures that will result in the same outcome as required under the relevant
provision, and for the reasons set out above, we have applied for, and the Stock Exchange has agreed
to grant, a waiver from the requirement set out in Paragraph 14 of Appendix 3.

As regards shareholders

Paragraph 3(1) of Part B of Appendix 13 provides that the articles of association shall stipulate
that any annual general meeting must be called by notice of at least 21 days, and that any other general
meeting (including an extraordinary general meeting) must be called by notice of at least 14 days and
the articles of association shall stipulate that the notice convening a meeting shall contain particulars
of the resolutions to be considered at that meeting. The note to paragraph 3(1) of Part B of Appendix
13 further provides that the articles of association may provide that issuers may convene a general
meeting on shorter notice than required under this provision or the companies’ articles of association
if it is agreed: (a) in the case of an annual general meeting, by all the members entitled to attend and
vote at the meeting; and (b) in any other case, by a majority in number of the members having the right
to attend and vote at the meeting, being a majority together representing at least 95% of the total
voting rights at the meeting of all the members. The Company has historically provided notice of at
least the minimum amounts required by the Articles Requirements, and has undertaken to the Stock
Exchange to put forth a resolution at the Next GM to revise the Articles so that the notice period for
any annual general meeting shall be at least 21 days and the notice period for any other general
meeting shall be at least 14 days. On the basis of this undertaking, and for the reasons set out above,
we have applied for, and the Stock Exchange has agreed to grant, a waiver from the requirement set
out in Paragraph 3(1) of Part B of Appendix 13.

Paragraph 3(2) of Part B of Appendix 13 provides the articles of association shall provide for the
branch register of members in Hong Kong to be open for inspection by members but may permit the
company to close the register in terms equivalent to section 632 of the Companies Ordinance. Under
our Articles, our directors may disclose the information in the register of members to the shareholders
providing a comparable level of shareholder protection. The Company has also undertaken to the
Stock Exchange to make the Hong Kong Branch Register open for inspection by members and has
made arrangements with its Hong Kong Branch Registrar to give effect to this. On the basis that we
