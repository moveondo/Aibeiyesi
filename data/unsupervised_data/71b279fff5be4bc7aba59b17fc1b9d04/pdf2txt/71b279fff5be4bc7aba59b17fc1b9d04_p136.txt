WAIVERS FROM COMPLIANCE WITH THE LISTING RULES AND EXEMPTIONS FROM

THE COMPANIES (WINDING UP AND MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS) ORDINANCE

In addition, having considered the Proposed Acquisition 1 and the Proposed Acquisition 2 are
immaterial and do not expect to have any material effect on the business, financial condition or
operations of the Group,
it would not be meaningful and would be unduly burdensome for the
Company to prepare and include the financial information of Company X or Company Y during the
Track Record Period in the listing documents of the Company.

3.

Alternative disclosure in the prospectus

We will provide alternative information in the Prospectus in connection with the Proposed
Acquisition 1 and the Proposed Acquisition 2. Such information includes, where applicable, those
which would be required for a discloseable transaction under Chapter 14 of the Listing Rules
including, for example, reasons for the investments and a confirmation that the counterparties and the
ultimate beneficial owners of the counterparties are independent third parties of the Company and its
connected persons.

We do not expect to use any proceeds from the Proposed Listing to fund the Proposed Acquisition

1 or the Proposed Acquisition 2.

WAIVER IN RESPECT OF CLAWBACK MECHANISM

Under Paragraph 4.2 of Practice Note 18 to the Listing Rules, where an initial public offering
includes both a placing tranche and a public subscription tranche, the minimum allocation of shares
to the public subscription tranche shall be an initial allocation of 10% of the shares offered in the
initial public offering and subject to a clawback mechanism that increases the number of shares
available in the public subscription tranche depending on the demand for those shares as set out in the
paragraph. We have applied to the Stock Exchange for, and the Stock Exchange has granted us, a
waiver from strict compliance with Paragraph 4.2 of Practice Note 18 to the Listing Rules such that,
in the event of over-subscription,
the alternative clawback mechanism shall be applied to the
provisions under Paragraph 4.2 of Practice Note 18 of the Listing Rules, following the closing of the
application lists. For further information of such clawback mechanism, please see the section headed
“Structure of the Global Offering — The Hong Kong Public Offering — Reallocation”.
