rash (13%), arthralgia (12%), muscle spasms (12%) and urinary tract infection (12%). All of these
events were grade 1 or 2 except for one case of grade 3 purpura (subcutaneous hemorrhage), which
was the only major bleeding event. Additional AEs of interest included one case of each grade 2
diarrhea and grade 2 atrial fibrillation. A total of 18 SAEs occurred in 13 patients, with no SAE
occurring in more than one patient. Only one patient discontinued treatment due to an AE, a grade 2
pleural effusion.

At the time of the data cutoff, 66 patients (16 TN and 50 R/R) had more than 12 weeks of
follow-up and were evaluable for efficacy, and three other patients had less than 12 weeks of
follow-up. After a median follow-up of 10.5 months (2.2—26.8 months), the ORR was 94% (62/66)
with complete responses, or CRs, in 3% (2/66), PRs in 82% (54/66), and PRs with lymphocytosis, or
PR-Ls, in 9% (6/66) of patients. Stable disease, or SD, was observed in 5% (3/66) of patients. The
patient with pleural effusion discontinued treatment prior to week 12 and was not evaluable for
response. There was one instance of Hodgkin’s transformation. In TN CLL/SLL, at a median follow-up
time of 7.6 months (3.7—11.6 months), the ORR was 100% (16/16) with CRs in 6% (1/16), PRs in
81% (13/16) and PR-Ls in 13% (2/16) of patients. In R/R CLL/SLL, at a median follow-up time of
14.0 months (2.2—26.8 months), the ORR was 92% (46/50) with CRs in 2% (1/50), PRs in 82%
(41/50) and PR-Ls in 8% (4/50) of patients. SD was observed in 6% (3/50) patients.
