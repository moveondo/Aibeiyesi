STRUCTURE OF THE GLOBAL OFFERING

(subject to reallocation and the Over-allotment Option). The number of Offer Shares initially offered
under the International Placing, subject to any reallocation of Offer Shares between the International
Placing and the Hong Kong Public Offering, will represent approximately 8.55% of the total Shares
in issue immediately following the completion of the Global Offering (assuming the Over-allotment
Option is not exercised).

Allocation

The International Placing will include marketing of Offer Shares in the United States as well as
institutional and professional investors and other investors anticipated to have a sizeable demand for
such Offer Shares in Hong Kong and other jurisdictions outside the United States. Professional
investors generally include brokers, dealers, companies (including fund managers) whose ordinary
business involves dealing in shares and other securities and corporate entities that regularly invest in
shares and other securities. Allocation of Offer Shares pursuant to the International Placing will be
effected in accordance with the “book-building” process described in sub-section headed “Pricing and
Allocation” in this section and based on a number of factors, including the level and timing of demand,
the total size of the relevant investor’s invested assets or equity assets in the relevant sector and
whether or not it is expected that the relevant investor is likely to buy further Shares and/or hold or
sell its Shares after the Listing. Such allocation is intended to result in a distribution of the Shares on
a basis which would lead to the establishment of a solid professional and institutional shareholder base
to the benefit of the Group and the Shareholders as a whole.

The Joint Global Coordinators (on behalf of the Underwriters) may require any investor who has
been offered Offer Shares under the International Placing and who has made an application under the
Hong Kong Public Offering to provide sufficient information to the Joint Global Coordinators so as
to allow it to identify the relevant applications under the Hong Kong Public Offering and to ensure
that they are excluded from any allocation of Offer Shares under the Hong Kong Public Offering.

Reallocation

The total number of Offer Shares to be issued or sold pursuant to the International Placing may
change as a result of the clawback arrangement described in the subsection “The Hong Kong Public
Offering — Reallocation” in this section above, the exercise of the Over-allotment Option in whole
or in part and/or any reallocation of unsubscribed Offer Shares originally included in the Hong Kong
Public Offering.

OVER-ALLOTMENT OPTION

In connection with the Global Offering, the Company is expected to grant the Over-allotment
Option to the International Underwriters, exercisable by the Joint Global Coordinators (on behalf of
the International Underwriters).

Pursuant

to the Over-allotment Option,

the International Underwriters will have the right,
exercisable by the Joint Global Coordinators (on behalf of the International Underwriters) at any time
from the Listing Date until 30 days after the last day for lodging applications under the Hong Kong
