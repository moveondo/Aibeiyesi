BUSINESS

Overview

We are a commercial-stage biotechnology company focused on developing and commercializing
the treatment of cancer. Our
innovative molecularly-targeted and immuno-oncology drugs for
internally-developed lead drug candidates are currently in late-stage clinical
trials, and we are
marketing three in-licensed drugs in China from which we have been generating product revenue since
September 2017. Our mission is to become a global
leader in the discovery, development and
commercialization of innovative therapies.

Our Core Product Candidates include the following:

•

•

•

Zanubrutinib (BGB-3111) — a potentially best-in-class investigational small molecule
inhibitor of BTK, that is currently being evaluated in a broad pivotal clinical program in
China and in other markets, including the United States and the European Union, which we
refer to as globally, for which we expect to file for approval in China in 2018 initially for
the treatment of MCL, and submit in the first half of 2019 an NDA to the FDA to pursue
an accelerated approval for the treatment of WM;

Tislelizumab (BGB-A317) — an investigational humanized monoclonal antibody against
the immune checkpoint receptor PD-1 that is currently being evaluated in a broad pivotal
clinical program globally and in China, for which we expect to file for approval in China
in 2018 initially for the treatment of cHL; and

Pamiparib (BGB-290) — an investigational small molecule inhibitor of the PARP1 and
PARP2 enzymes that is being evaluated in two pivotal clinical trials in China and a global
Phase 3 trial.

We are preparing to launch the two lead product candidates from our

internal pipeline,
zanubrutinib and tislelizumab, which we believe will address major unmet medical needs and have
significant commercial potential.

In addition to our three late-stage clinical drug candidates, our pipeline also includes three
internally-developed drug candidates in Phase 1 clinical development:
lifirafenib (BGB-283), an
investigational RAF dimer inhibitor, BGB-A333, an investigational humanized monoclonal antibody
against the immune checkpoint receptor ligand PD-L1, and BGB-A425, an investigational humanized
monoclonal antibody against TIM-3.
