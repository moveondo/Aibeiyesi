Another potential therapeutic utility of PARP inhibitors is combination therapy that has strong
scientific rational. PARP proteins are key factors in base-excision-repair, which is critical for the
repair of DNA lesions caused by some chemotherapeutic agents and by radiation. PARP inhibitors are
hypothesized to potentiate cytotoxicity of DNA-alkylating agents such as platinum compounds,
temozolomide and ionizing radiation and may be used in combination with these agents in treating
various cancers.

Role of PARP and BRCA in DNA Repair

DNA

SSB = single-strand DNA breaks, BRCA=breast cancer gene, PARPi=poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor.

PARP inhibitors are also considered good potential combination partners with checkpoint
inhibitors in part due to increased mutations in tumor cells as a result of the blockade of DNA repair
by PARP inhibitors as a higher mutational load of cancers has been shown in clinical studies to
correlate with improved response to checkpoint inhibitors. In addition, preclinical data suggest that
BRCA mutant
tumors which are sensitive to PARP inhibition are likely to be immunogenic and
responsive to PD-1 or PD-L1 antibodies.

Market Opportunity and Competition

We believe that the market opportunity for PARP inhibitors is large and expanding in various
tumor histologies, settings and patient segments. Many tumor types have been shown to be responsive
to PARP inhibitors,
including OC, breast cancer, prostate cancer and GC. PARP inhibitors have
demonstrated encouraging activities both in relapsed and refractory patients as well as in the
maintenance setting. In the United States, each year there are approximately 22,440 new cases of OC,
252,710 new cases of breast cancer, 161,360 new cases of prostate cancer, and 28,000 new cases of
GC, according to the U.S. National Cancer Institute. In China, each year there are approximately
52,000 new cases of OC, 272,000 new cases of breast cancer, 60,000 new cases of prostate cancer, and
680,000 new cases of GC according to Chen et al. 2016.
