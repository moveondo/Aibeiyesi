APPENDIX III

SUMMARY OF THE CONSTITUTION OF THE
COMPANY AND CAYMAN COMPANIES LAW

Proceedings of Board of Directors

Our Articles provide that our business is to be managed and conducted by our Board. The quorum
necessary for a board meeting may be fixed by the board and, unless so fixed at another number, will
be a majority of the directors.

Our Articles provide that the board may from time to time at its discretion exercise all powers
of our company to raise capital or borrow money,
to mortgage or charge all or any part of the
undertaking, property and assets (present and future) and uncalled capital of our company and, subject
to the Companies Law, issue debentures, bonds and other securities of our company, whether outright
or as collateral security for any debt, liability or obligation of our company or of any third party.

A director who has a direct or indirect interest in any contract, business or arrangement in which
the Company or its affiliates is a party or becomes a party shall declare the nature of his interest at
a meeting of the directors. The power of such interested director to vote in respect of any such contract
or transaction or proposed contract and be counted in as the quorum in the relevant board meeting is
subject to the Nasdaq Stock Market Rules and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange Listing Rules and
disqualification by the chairman of the relevant board meeting.

Inspection of Books and Records

Holders of our ordinary shares will have no general right under Companies Law to inspect or
obtain copies of our list of shareholders or our corporate records provided that they are entitled to a
copy of the current Articles of Association.

Changes in Capital

Our shareholders may from time to time by ordinary resolution:

•

•

•

•

increase the share capital by such sum, to be divided into shares of such classes and amount,
as the resolution shall prescribe;

consolidate and divide all or any of our share capital into shares of a larger amount than
our existing shares;

sub-divide our existing shares, or any of them into shares of a smaller amount, provided that
in the subdivision the proportion between the amount paid and the amount, if any, unpaid
on each reduced share shall be the same as it was in case of the share from which the
reduced share is derived; or

cancel any shares which, at the date of the passing of the resolution, have not been taken
or agreed to be taken by any person and diminish the amount of our share capital by the
amount of the shares so cancelled.
