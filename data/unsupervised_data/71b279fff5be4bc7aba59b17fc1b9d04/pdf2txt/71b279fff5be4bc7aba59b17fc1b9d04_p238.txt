Currently approved first-generation BRAF inhibitors, vemurafenib and dabrafenib, are only
active against the BRAF monomer. Because lifirafenib is designed to inhibit both the monomer and
dimer forms of RAF, we believe lifirafenib has the potential to be a first-in-class RAF dimer inhibitor.
Lifirafenib was evaluated in a multicenter, open-label Phase 1 trial conducted in Australia and New
Zealand comprised of two parts — dose escalation and dose expansion — in patients with BRAF or
KRAS/NRAS mutated solid tumors or patients with pancreatic cancer. Lifirafenib demonstrated
antitumor activity in both BRAF and KRAS-mutated tumors in preclinical studies and in the
dose-escalation portion of this Phase 1 trial.

We presented data from the dose-expansion portion of the trial at the 2017 American Association
for Cancer Research Annual Meeting. The dose-expansion portion of the trial was designed to evaluate
the safety and efficacy of lifirafenib at the recommended Phase 2 dose of 30 mg once daily established
in the dose-escalation part of the trial. In the dose-expansion portion,
lifirafenib was generally
well-tolerated at a dose of 30 mg once daily and continued to show antitumor activity in patients with
BRAF V600-mutated solid tumors and patients with KRAS-mutated solid tumors. The safety analysis,
which included 96 patients as of the September 12, 2016 cutoff, suggested that
lifirafenib was
generally well-tolerated at 30 mg once daily, with most drug-related AEs being grades 1 or 2 in
severity. The most frequent drug-related AEs (≥10%) of any grade were fatigue (38.5%), dysphonia
(26.0%), decreased appetite
(21.9%),
thrombocytopenia (19.8%), dermatitis acneiform (17.7%), diarrhea (16.7%), rash (16.7%), nausea
(15.6%), hypertension (11.5%) and glossodynia (10.4%). The most frequent drug-related grade 3 and
4 AEs (≥ 2%, two patients or more) included fatigue (7.3%), hypertension (6.3%), thrombocytopenia
(6.3%), pyrexia (3.1%), hyponatremia (2.1%), anemia (2.1%), neutropenia (2.1%), febrile neutropenia
(2.1%), decreased platelet count (2.1%), increased alanine aminotransferase (2.1%), increased GGT
(2.1%) and sepsis (2.1%).

The cutoff for the efficacy analysis was September 17, 2016. In seven patients with BRAF
V600-mutated melanoma (including one V600K and one V600R) who were naïve to BRAF or MEK
inhibitors, there were three PRs and three cases of SD. In three patients with BRAF V600-mutated
PTC, there was one PR and two cases of SD. In six patients with KRAS-mutated NSCLC, there was
one PR and two cases of SD. In ten patients with solid tumors with BRAF non-V600 mutations or solid
tumors with BRAF V600 mutations that are not included in other cohorts, there were two PRs, in one
patient with BRAF V600E-mutated melanoma and one with BRAF V600E-mutated OC, and three
cases of SD. In two patients with BRAF V600-mutated NSCLC, there was one unconfirmed PR and
one case of SD. Additional cases of SD were observed in four of six melanoma patients with BRAF
V600-mutated melanoma who had responses to but developed resistance against BRAF or MEK
inhibitors, nine of 13 patients with BRAF V600-mutated CRC,
five patients with
KRAS-mutated endometrial cancer, 12 of 20 patients with KRAS/NRAS-mutated CRC, and 10 of 21
patients with other KRAS/NRAS-mutated solid tumors or pancreatic cancer. In the Phase 1a portion
of the trial, confirmed objective responses included a CR in a patient with BRAF V600E-mutated
melanoma and two PRs, one in a patient with BRAF V600E-mutated thyroid cancer and one in a
patient with KRAS-mutated endometrial cancer.
