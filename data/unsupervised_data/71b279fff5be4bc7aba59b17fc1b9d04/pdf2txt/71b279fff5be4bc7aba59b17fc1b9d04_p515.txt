2011 Option Plan

Summary

The following is a summary of the principal terms of the 2011 Option Plan as approved by the
Board on April 15, 2011 and amended on April 17, 2015. The terms of the 2011 Option Plan are not
subject to the provisions of Chapter 17 of the Listing Rules as our Board has determined not to grant
any further options under the 2011 Option Plan after February 2, 2016 when our 2016 Share Option
and Incentive Plan became effective.

The shares issuable pursuant to awards granted under the 2011 Option Plan are authorized but
unissued shares. The shares underlying any awards that are forfeited, cancelled, or otherwise
terminated (other than by exercise), and the shares withheld upon exercise of an option to cover the
exercise price or tax withholding are added to the pool for issuance under the 2011 Option Plan.
