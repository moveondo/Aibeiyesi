Expand Our Product Portfolio and Pipeline Through Collaborations with Other Biopharmaceutical
Companies to Complement Our Internal Research

We expect to further expand our portfolio of drugs and drug candidates, in oncology as well as
potentially in other therapeutic areas, through internal research and external collaborations. We intend
to pursue collaborations with other biopharmaceutical companies both in China and globally by
leveraging our strong clinical development capabilities. We have pursued and plan to continue to
pursue business development opportunities, such as our collaboration with Mirati,
in which
development in China is expected to contribute to, and potentially accelerate, the global development
program. We believe that
there will be increasing interest by international biopharmaceutical
companies in seeking collaborations in Asia, particularly in oncology, where clinical recruitment is a
major bottleneck in new drug development.
