APPENDIX I

Dividends

ACCOUNTANTS’ REPORT

The holders of the Preferred Shares shall be entitled to receive dividends accruing at the rate of
8% per annum. In addition, holders of the Preferred Shares shall also be entitled to dividends on the
Company’s ordinary shares on an as if converted basis.

Voting rights

Each holder of the Preferred Shares shall have the right to vote the number of votes per ordinary
share into which their Preferred Shares could be converted, and shall vote along with the ordinary
shares, on all matters in respect of which the holders of ordinary shares are entitled to vote.

Liquidation preference

In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
Company or any deemed liquidation event as defined in the Preferred Shares agreements (“Liquidation
Transaction”), the holders of Preferred Shares then outstanding are entitled to be paid out of the assets
of the Company available for distribution to its members before any payment shall be made to the
holders of any other class of shares by reason of their ownership thereof, an amount per share equal
to the greater of (i) the original issue price, plus accrued but unpaid dividends; and (ii) such amount
per share as would have been payable had all Preferred Shares been converted into ordinary shares
immediately prior to such liquidation, dissolution, winding up or deemed liquidation event.

Conversion rights

(i) Optional conversion: Each Preferred Share shall be convertible into the Company’s
ordinary shares at the option of the holder at any time after the issuance date by dividing
the original issue price by the conversion price, which is initially equal to the original issue
price. All unpaid, cumulative dividends on the Preferred Shares shall no longer be payable.

(ii) Automatic conversion: All outstanding Preferred Shares shall automatically be converted
into ordinary shares at the then effective Preferred Shares conversion price upon (i) the
closing of a qualified initial public offering; or (ii) the date and time, or the occurrence of
an event, specified by vote or written consent of the holders of at least 80.63% of the then
outstanding Preferred Shares. Upon conversion of
the Preferred Shares, all unpaid,
cumulative dividends on the Preferred Shares shall no longer be payable.

Drag-along right

In the event

that each of (i) (A) Baker Brothers or (B) Hillhouse BGN Holdings Limited
(“Hillhouse”) and CB Biotech Investment Limited (“CITIC PE”) jointly; (ii) a majority of the Board
of Directors; and (iii) the holders of more than 66.66% of the then-outstanding ordinary shares (other
than those issued or issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Shares and any other derivative
securities) approve a sale of the Company in writing, then each preferred shareholder agrees to certain
joint actions to be taken to ensure such sale of the Company could be completed.
