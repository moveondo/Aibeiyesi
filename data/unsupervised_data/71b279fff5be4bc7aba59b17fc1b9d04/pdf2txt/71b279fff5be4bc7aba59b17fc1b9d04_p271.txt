scope of other standards, such as leases,

instruments. Under the Revenue ASUs, an entity recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control
of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration that the entity expects to
receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements
that an entity determines are within the scope of the Revenue ASUs, the entity performs the following
five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the
contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance
obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance
