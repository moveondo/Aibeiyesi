CORNERSTONE INVESTORS

THE CORNERSTONE PLACING

We have entered into cornerstone investment agreements (each a “Cornerstone Investment
the “Cornerstone Investment Agreements”) with the cornerstone
Agreement”, and together
investors described below (each a “Cornerstone Investor”, and together,
the “Cornerstone
Investors”), pursuant to which the Cornerstone Investors have agreed to, subject to certain conditions,
acquire at the Offer Price a certain number of our Offer Shares, being 5,424,000 Offer Shares to be
purchased by the Hillhouse Funds (as defined below) and the Offer Shares that may be purchased with
an aggregate investment amount of US$205,000,000 (approximately HK$1,609,065,500) by the
remaining Cornerstone Investors (the “Cornerstone Placing”).

Assuming an Offer Price of HK$94.40, being the low-end of the indicative Offer Price range set
out in this prospectus, the total number of Offer Shares to be acquired by the Cornerstone Investors
would be 22,469,000 Offer Shares, representing approximately 34.25% of the Offer Shares and
approximately 2.93% of our total issued share capital immediately upon completion of the Global
Offering (assuming the Over-allotment Option and no Shares are issued pursuant to the Equity Plans).

Assuming an Offer Price of HK$103.00, being the mid-point of the indicative Offer Price range
set out in this prospectus, the total number of Offer Shares to be acquired by the Cornerstone Investors
would be 21,045,800 Offer Shares, representing approximately 32.08% of the Offer Shares and
approximately 2.74% of our total issued share capital immediately upon completion of the Global
Offering (assuming the Over-allotment Option and no Shares are issued pursuant to the Equity Plans).

Assuming an Offer Price of HK$111.60, being the high-end of the indicative Offer Price range
set out in this prospectus, the total number of Shares to be acquired by the Cornerstone Investors
would be 19,842,000 Offer Shares, representing approximately 30.25% of the Offer Shares and
approximately 2.59% of our total issued share capital immediately upon completion of the Global
Offering (assuming the Over-allotment Option and no Shares are issued pursuant to the Equity Plans).

The Cornerstone Placing will form part of the International Placing and the Cornerstone
Investors will not acquire any Offer Shares under the Global Offering (other than pursuant to the
Cornerstone Investment Agreements). The Offer Shares to be acquired by the Cornerstone Investors
will rank parri passu in all respect with the fully paid Shares in issue and will not count towards the
public float of our Company under Rule 18A.07 of the Listing Rules. Immediately following the
completion of the Global Offering, save for the Baker Bros. Entities (as defined below) and the
Hillhouse Funds, the Cornerstone Investors will not have any Board representation in our Company,
nor will
they become a substantial shareholder of the Company. To the best knowledge of our
Company, except for the Baker Bros. Entities and the Hillhouse Funds, each of the Cornerstone
Investors is an Independent Third Party and is not our connected person (as defined in the Listing
Rules).
