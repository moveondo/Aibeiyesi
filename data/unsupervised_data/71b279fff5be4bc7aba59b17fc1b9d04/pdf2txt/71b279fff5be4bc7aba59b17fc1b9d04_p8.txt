Tislelizumab (BGB-A317) — an investigational humanized monoclonal antibody against
the immune checkpoint receptor PD-1 that is currently being evaluated in a broad pivotal
clinical program globally and in China, for which we expect to file for approval in China
in 2018 initially for the treatment of classical Hodgkin’s lymphoma, or cHL; and

Pamiparib (BGB-290) — an investigational small molecule inhibitor of the PARP1 and
PARP2 enzymes that is being evaluated in two pivotal clinical trials in China and a global
Phase 3 trial.

We are preparing to launch the two lead product candidates from our

internal pipeline,
zanubrutinib and tislelizumab, which we believe will address major unmet medical needs and have
significant commercial potential. For zanubrutinib (BGB-3111), we had a pre-NDA meeting with the
China Drug Administration, or CDA (formerly known as the China Food and Drug Administration, or
CFDA), earlier this year and based on the feedback we received from the meeting, we currently
believe we are on track to file the NDA for the treatment of relapsed/refractory MCL in 2018. In July
2018, zanubrutinib was granted Fast Track Designation by the FDA for the treatment of patients with
WM. Based on our discussions with the FDA, internal review of available data from our global Phase
1 trial of zanubrutinib in patients with WM, and supported by the Fast Track Designation, we are
preparing to submit in the first half of 2019 an NDA to pursue an accelerated approval of zanubrutinib
for patients with WM based on results from the global Phase 1 study. For tislelizumab (BGB-A317),
we had a pre-NDA meeting with the CDA, and based on the feedback we received from the meeting,
we believe we are on track to file the NDA in China for the treatment of cHL in 2018.

In addition to our three late-stage clinical drug candidates, our pipeline also includes three
internally-developed drug candidates in Phase 1 clinical development:
lifirafenib (BGB-283), an
investigational RAF dimer inhibitor, BGB-A333, an investigational humanized monoclonal antibody
against the immune checkpoint receptor ligand PD-L1, and BGB-A425, an investigational humanized
monoclonal antibody against T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain containing-3, or TIM-3.

We entered into a strategic collaboration with Celgene Corporation, or Celgene, in August 2017,
in which we obtained an exclusive license to market in China Celgene’s approved cancer therapies
ABRAXANE威, REVLIMID威 and VIDAZA威, as well as rights in China to develop and commercialize
avadomide (CC-122), an investigational next-generation cereblon modulator currently in clinical
development by Celgene outside of China for lymphomas and hepatocellular carcinoma, or HCC. As
part of the collaboration, we also granted Celgene an exclusive right to develop and commercialize
tislelizumab for solid tumors in the United States, Europe, Japan and the rest of world other than Asia,
for which we received US$263 million in upfront
license fees and a US$150 million equity
investment. We may also receive up to US$980 million in potential development, regulatory and sales
milestone payments and tiered royalties based on percentages of annual net sales, depending on
specified terms,
to mid-twenties, with customary reductions in specified
circumstances.

Our portfolio also includes sitravatinib, an in-licensed,

investigational, spectrum-selective
kinase inhibitor in clinical development by Mirati Therapeutics, Inc., or Mirati, for the treatment of
non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC, and other tumors, for which we are planning to initiate clinical
development in China.
