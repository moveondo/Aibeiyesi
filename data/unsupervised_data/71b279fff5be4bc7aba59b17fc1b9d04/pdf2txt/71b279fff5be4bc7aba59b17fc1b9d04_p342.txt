DIRECTORS AND SENIOR MANAGEMENT

We aim to implement a high standard of corporate governance, which is crucial to safeguard the
interests of our Shareholders. To accomplish this, we expect to comply with the Corporate Governance
Code after the Listing save for matters disclosed above.

COMPLIANCE ADVISER

We have appointed Somerley Capital Limited as our compliance adviser (the “Compliance
Adviser”) pursuant to Rule 3A.19 of the Listing Rules. Our Compliance Adviser will provide us with
guidance and advice as to compliance with the Listing Rules and applicable Hong Kong laws. Pursuant
to Rule 3A.23 of the Listing Rules, our Compliance Adviser will advise our Company in certain
circumstances including:

(a)

before the publication of any regulatory announcement, circular, or financial report;

(b) where a transaction, which might be a notifiable or connected transaction, is contemplated,

including share issues and share repurchases;

(c) where we propose to use the proceeds of the Global Offering in a manner different from that
detailed in this prospectus or where the business activities, development or results of our
Group deviate from any forecast, estimate or other information in this prospectus; and

(d) where the Stock Exchange makes an inquiry to our Company regarding unusual movements
in the price or trading volume of its listed securities or any other matters in accordance with
Rule 13.10 of the Listing Rules.

The term of appointment of our Compliance Adviser shall commence on the Listing Date and is
expected to end on the date on which we comply with Rule 13.46 of the Listing Rules in respect of
our financial results for the first full financial year commencing after the Listing Date.

COMPETITION

Each of our Directors confirms that as of the Latest Practicable Date, he did not have any interest
in a business which competes or is likely to compete, directly or indirectly, with our business, and
requires disclosure under Rule 8.10 of the Listing Rules.

From time to time our non-executive Directors may serve on the boards of both private and
public companies within the broader healthcare and biotechnology industries, including companies
whose products may directly or indirectly compete with ours. However, as these non-executive
Directors are neither our controlling shareholders nor members of our executive management team, we
do not believe that their interests in such companies as directors would render us incapable of carrying
on our business independently from the other companies in which they may hold directorships from
time to time.
