AEs assessed by the investigator to be treatment-related occurred in seven patients (39%). Of
those, only fatigue (11%, all grade 1 or 2) was reported in more than one patient. One case of grade
3 nausea was the only treatment-related AE of grade 3 or higher in severity. No patient discontinued
treatment due to a treatment-related AE, and of the nine deaths reported, none were considered to be
treatment-related.

The efficacy-evaluable population included 17 HNSCC patients. Despite short median follow-up
time, three achieved a confirmed PR and six achieved SD. At the time of the data cutoff, three patients
remained on treatment.

Ovarian Cancer

The OC dataset included 51 patients treated with tislelizumab at different dose levels (0.5 to 10
mg/kg Q2W in dose escalation, 2 or 5 mg/kg Q2W or Q3W or 200 mg Q3W in dose expansion, or 5
mg/kg Q3W in indication expansion). At the time of the data cutoff on June 8, 2017, median treatment
duration was 71 days (range 29—540 days).

AEs assessed by the investigator to be treatment-related occurred in 28 patients (55%). Of those,
fatigue (18%), pruritus (10%), rash (10%), diarrhea (10%), lethargy (6%), nausea (6%), abdominal
pain (4%), dry eye (4%), dry skin (4%), onychoclasis (4%) and maculo-papular rash (4%) were
reported in more than one patient, and all, except one case of grade 3 diarrhea, were grades 1 or 2.
Two additional treatment-related AEs of grade 3 or higher included one case each of grade 3 pyrexia
and stomatitis. SAEs considered to be treatment-related occurred in three patients and included one
case each of pyrexia, colitis and mucosal inflammation.

The efficacy-evaluable population included 50 OC patients. Two achieved a confirmed PR and

20 achieved SD. At the time of the data cutoff, six patients remained on treatment.

Urothelial Cancer

The UC dataset included 16 patients. Of these, 12 had one or more prior systemic anticancer
treatment for metastatic disease and the remaining four had progressed after receiving platinum-based
regimen in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting. In addition, five patients had prior radiotherapy. At
the time of the data cutoff on August 28, 2017, median treatment duration was 4.3 months (range of
0.7 to 18.3 months). A total of six patients remained on treatment.

AEs assessed by the investigator to be treatment-related occurred in 14 patients (88%). Of those,
fatigue (31%), rash (19%), infusion-related reactions (13%), nausea (13%), pain in extremity (13%)
and proteinuria (13%) occurred in more than one patient. All of the treatment-related AEs were grade
1 or 2 except one case each of fatigue, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus. One AE of muscle
weakness, which was associated with disease progression and occurred more than one month after the
last dose of tislelizumab, had a fatal outcome. This event was considered by the investigator not to
be treatment-related.
