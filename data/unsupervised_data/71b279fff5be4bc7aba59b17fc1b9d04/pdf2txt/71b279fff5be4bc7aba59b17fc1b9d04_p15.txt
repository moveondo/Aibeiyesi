SUMMARY

PD-1/PD-L1 Competitive Landscape in China (Late-Stage)

Binding of the PD-1 ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, to the PD-1 receptor found on T-cells, inhibits T-cell proliferation and cytokine
production. Upregulation of PD-1 ligands occurs in some tumors and signaling through this pathway can contribute to inhibition

of active T-cell immune surveillance of tumors. Thus, PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor antibodies could inhibit this pathway and

reactivate the T-cell immune surveillance of tumors.

PARP Competitive Landscape in China (Late-Stage)

PARP inhibitors are involved in DNA transcription and repair. PARP can detect and initiate the immediate cellular response

to chemical or radiation-induced single-strand DNA breaks by signaling the enzymatic machinery involved in the repair

process. Cancer cells with mutations in breast cancer susceptibility gene, or BRCA1/2 genes, are highly sensitive to PARP

inhibition. This phenomenon is called “synthetic lethality” and is the foundation of the therapeutic utility of PARP

inhibition in cancer therapy.
