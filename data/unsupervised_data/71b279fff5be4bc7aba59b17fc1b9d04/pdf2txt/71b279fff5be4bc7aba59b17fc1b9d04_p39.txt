us and our business. Some of these may not correspond to standard industry definitions.

As used herein, the terms set forth below shall have the following meanings:

Alpha-fetoprotein

ALT

AST

AML

BRAF

B-cell

Bcl-2

BCR

BRCA

BTK

protein

normally

produced

fetus.
Means
Alpha-fetoprotein levels are usually undetectable in the blood
of healthy adult men or women (who are not pregnant). An
elevated level of alpha-fetoprotein suggests the presence of
either a primary liver cancer or germ cell tumor

by

a

Means alanine aminotransferase

Means aspartate aminotransferase

Means acute mycloid leukemia

Means a human gene that makes the B-raf protein involved in
sending internal cell signals that direct cell growth

that differs from other
Means a type of white blood cell
lymphocytes like T-cells by the presence of the BCR on the
B-cell’s outer surface. Also known as B-lymphocytes

A protein that helps control whether a cell lives or dies by
blocking a type of cell death called apoptosis. The gene for
Bcl2 is found on chromosome 18, and transfer of the Bcl2
gene to a different chromosome is seen in many B-cell
leukemias and lymphomas. This causes the Bcl2 protein to be
made in larger amounts, which may keep cancer cells from
dying

Means B-cell receptor, a specialized receptor protein that
allows a B-cell to bind to specific antigens

(BRCA1

and BRCA2). BRCA proteins

Means breast cancer susceptibility gene, of which there are
two
key
components of homologous
recombination DNA repair
pathway. BRCA deleterious mutations are associated with
breast and ovarian cancers

are

Means Bruton’s tyrosine kinase. BTK is a key component of
the BCR signaling pathway and is an important regulator of
cell proliferation and cell survival in various lymphomas
