RISK FACTORS

compliance with cGMP and adherence to commitments made in any NDA or Biologics License
Application, or BLA, other marketing application, and previous responses to any inspection
observations. Accordingly, we and others with whom we work must continue to expend time, money
and effort in all areas of regulatory compliance, including manufacturing, production and quality
control.

The regulatory approvals for our drugs and any approvals that we receive for our drug candidates
are and may be subject to limitations on the approved indicated uses for which the drug may be
marketed or to the conditions of approval, which could adversely affect
the drug’s commercial
potential or contain requirements for potentially costly post-marketing testing and surveillance to
monitor the safety and efficacy of the drug or drug candidate. The FDA or comparable regulatory
authorities may also require a REMS program as a condition of approval of our drug candidates or
following approval, as is the case with REVLIMID威. In addition,
if the FDA, CDA, EMA or a
comparable regulatory authority approves our drug candidates, we will have to comply with
requirements including, for example, submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and
reports, registration, as well as continued compliance with cGMP and Good Clinical Practice, or GCP,
for any clinical trials that we conduct post-approval.

The FDA or comparable regulatory authorities may seek to impose a consent decree or withdraw
marketing approval if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if problems occur
after the drug reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with our drugs or
drug candidates or with our drug’s manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory
requirements, may result
in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information;
imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks; or imposition of
distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences
include, among other things:

•

•

•

•

•

restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of our drugs, withdrawal of the product from
the market, or voluntary or mandatory product recalls;

fines, untitled or warning letters, or holds on clinical trials;

refusal by the FDA or comparable regulatory authorities to approve pending applications or
supplements to approved applications filed by us or suspension or revocation of license
approvals or withdrawal of approvals;

product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of our drugs and drug
candidates; and

injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.

The FDA and other regulatory authorities strictly regulate the marketing, labeling, advertising
and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for their
approved indications and for use in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA,
CDA, EMA and other regulatory authorities actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the
promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses
