SUMMARY

REVLIMID威 Competitive Landscape in China (Late-Stage)

Lenalidomide is an analogue of thalidomide with immunomodulatory, antiangiogenic, and antineoplastic properties. Cellular
activities of lenalidomide are mediated through its target cereblon, a component of a cullin ring E3 ubiquitin ligase enzyme

complex. In vitro, in the presence of drug, substrate proteins (including Aiolos, Ikaros, and CK1␣) are targeted for

ubiquitination and subsequent degradation leading to direct cytotoxic and immunomodulatory effects. Lenalidomide inhibits
proliferation and induces apoptosis of certain hematopoietic tumor cells including MM, mantle cell lymphoma, and del (5q)

myelodysplastic syndromes in vitro. Lenalidomide causes a delay in tumor growth in some in vivo nonclinical

hematopoietic tumor models including MM. Immunomodulatory properties of lenalidomide include increased number and

activation of T cells and natural killer (NK) cells leading to direct and enhanced antibody-dependent cell-mediated

cytotoxicity (ADCC) via increased secretion of interleukin-2 and interferon-gamma, increased numbers of NKT cells, and

inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF-␣ and IL-6) by monocytes. In MM cells, the combination of

lenalidomide and dexamethasone synergizes the inhibition of cell proliferation and the induction of apoptosis.

VIDAZA威 Competitive Landscape in China (Late-Stage)

VIDAZA威 is a pyrimidine nucleoside analog of cytidine. VIDAZA威 is believed to exert its antineoplastic effects by causing
hypomethylation of DNA and direct cytotoxicity on abnormal hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow. The concentration of

azacitidine required for maximum inhibition of DNA methylation in vitro does not cause major suppression of DNA

synthesis. Hypomethylation may restore normal function to genes that are critical for differentiation and proliferation. The

cytotoxic effects of azacitidine cause the death of rapidly dividing cells, including cancer cells that are no longer
responsive to normal growth control mechanisms. Non-proliferating cells are relatively insensitive to azacitidine.
