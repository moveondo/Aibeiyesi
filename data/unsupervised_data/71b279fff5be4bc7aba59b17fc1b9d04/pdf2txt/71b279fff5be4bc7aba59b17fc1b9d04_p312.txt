Indemnification Agreements

Cayman Islands law does not limit the extent to which a company’s Articles of Association may
provide indemnification of officers and Directors, except to the extent any such provision may be held
by the Cayman Islands courts to be contrary to public policy, such as providing indemnification
against civil fraud or the consequences of committing a crime. Our Articles provide that each officer
or Director shall be indemnified out of assets of our Company against all actions, proceedings, costs,
charges, expenses, losses, damages or liabilities incurred or sustained by such Directors or officer,
other than by reason of such person’s dishonesty, willful default or fraud, in or about the conduct of
our Company’s business or affairs (including as a result of any mistake of judgment) or in the
execution or discharge of his duties, powers, authorities or discretions, including without prejudice to
the generality of the foregoing, any costs, expenses, losses or liabilities incurred by such Director or
officer
in defending (whether successfully or otherwise) any civil proceedings concerning our
Company or its affairs in any court whether in the Cayman Islands or elsewhere.

In addition, we entered into indemnification agreements with our Directors and executive
officers that will provide such persons with additional indemnification beyond that provided in our
Articles. These agreements, among other things,
indemnify our Directors and executive officers
against certain liabilities and expenses incurred by such persons in connection with claims made by
reason of their being such a Director or executive officer.
