All dates and times refer to Hong Kong dates and times.

You will not be permitted to submit your application under the White Form eIPO service through the designated website
at www.eipo.com.hk after 11:30 a.m. on the last day for submitting applications. If you have already submitted your
application and obtained a payment reference number from the designated website prior to 11:30 a.m., you will be
permitted to continue the application process (by completing payment of the application monies) until 12:00 noon on the
last day for submitting applications, when the application lists close.

If there is a “black” rainstorm warning signal or a tropical cyclone warning signal number 8 or above in force in Hong
Kong at any time between 9:00 a.m. and 12:00 noon on Thursday, August 2, 2018, the application lists will not open and
close on that day. See “How to Apply for Hong Kong Offer Shares”.

The Share certificates will only become valid at 8:00 a.m. on the Listing Date, which is expected to be Wednesday,
August 8, 2018, provided that the Global Offering has become unconditional in all respects at or before that time.
Investors who trade Shares on the basis of publicly available allocation details or prior to the receipt of the Share
certificates or prior to the Share certificates becoming valid do so entirely at their own risk.

For details of the structure of the Global Offering, including its conditions, and the procedures
for applications for Hong Kong Offer Shares, see “Structure of the Global Offering” and “How to
Apply for Hong Kong Offer Shares”, respectively.

If the Global Offering does not become unconditional or is terminated in accordance with its
terms, the Global Offering will not proceed. In such a case, the Company will make an announcement
as soon as practicable thereafter.
