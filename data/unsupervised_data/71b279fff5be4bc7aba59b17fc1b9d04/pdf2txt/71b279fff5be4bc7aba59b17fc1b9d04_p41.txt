GLOSSARY OF TECHNICAL TERMS

Means Hodgkin’s lymphoma

Means head and neck squamous cell carcinoma

Means one type of
the most common class of antibody,
Immunoglobulin G, which includes IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and
IgG4

Means immunoglobulin M

Means glycoprotein molecules produced by plasma cells
(white blood cells), which are also known as antibodies. They
act as a critical part of the immune response by specifically
recognizing and binding to particular antigens,
such as
bacteria or viruses, and aiding in their destruction

Means a type of enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of
phosphate groups
from high-energy, phosphate-donating
molecules to specific substrates. The protein kinases make up
the majority of all kinases. Protein kinases act on proteins,
phosphorylating them on their serine, threonine, tyrosine, or
histidine residues. These kinases play a major role in protein
and enzyme regulation as well as signaling in the cell

KRAS is known as V-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral
oncogene homolog. It is an oncogene that is often mutated in
a number of cancers. The protein product of the normal KRAS
gene performs
tissue
signaling, and the mutation of a KRAS gene is an essential
step in the development of many cancers

function in normal

an essential

Means almost any abnormal change involving any biological
structure, tissue or organ due to disease or injury, similar in
meaning to the word “damage”

Major response

Means partial response or better

MAPK

MCL

MDS

Means mitogen-activated protein kinase. The MAPK pathway
is a chain of proteins in the cell that communicates a signal
from a receptor on the cell surface to the DNA in the nucleus
of the cell. This pathway includes a small G protein (RAS)
and three protein kinases (RAF, MEK, and ERK) and plays an
essential role in regulating cell proliferation and survival

Means mantle cell lymphoma

Means myclodysplastic syndromes
