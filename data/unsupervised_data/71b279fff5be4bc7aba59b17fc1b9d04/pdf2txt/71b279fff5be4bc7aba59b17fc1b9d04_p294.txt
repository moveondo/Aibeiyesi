Operating Capital Requirements

We do not expect to generate significant revenue from product sales unless and until we obtain
regulatory approval for and commercialize one of our current or future drug candidates. We have
exclusive rights to distribute and promote Celgene’s approved cancer therapies in China, for which we
began recognizing revenue in the third quarter of 2017. We anticipate that we will continue to generate
losses for the foreseeable future, and we expect our losses to increase as we continue the development
of, and seek regulatory approvals for, our drug candidates, and prepare for commercialization and
begin to commercialize any approved products. As a growing public company, we will continue to
incur additional costs associated with our operations. In addition, we expect to incur significant
commercialization expenses for product sales, marketing and manufacturing of our in-licensed drug
products in China and, subject to obtaining regulatory approval, our drug candidates. Accordingly, we
anticipate that we will need substantial additional
funding in connection with our continuing
operations.
