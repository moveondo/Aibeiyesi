Means marginal zone lymphoma

Means new drug application

Means non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma

Means Natural Killer cell, a type of immune cell that has
granules (small particles) with enzymes that can kill tumor
cells or cells infected with a virus. An NK-cell is a type of

an essential role in cell survival in response to DNA damage

Means partial response

Means partial response with lymphocytosis

Means programmed cell death protein 1,
an immune
checkpoint receptor expressed on T-cells and pro-B-cells that
binds two ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2. PD-1 is a cell surface
receptor that plays an important role in down-regulating the
