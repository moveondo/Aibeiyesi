Possible setting of the Offer Price after making a Downward Offer Price Adjustment.

We have the flexibility to make a Downward Offer Price Adjustment to set the final Offer Price
at up to 10% below the bottom end of the indicative Offer Price range per Share. It is therefore
possible that the final Offer Price will be set at HK$85.00 per Offer Share upon the making of a full
Downward Offer Price Adjustment. In such a situation, the Global Offering will proceed and the
Withdrawal Mechanism will not apply.

If the final Offer Price is set at HK$85.00, the estimated net proceeds we will receive from the

Global Offering will be reduced to HK$5,337.0 million.
