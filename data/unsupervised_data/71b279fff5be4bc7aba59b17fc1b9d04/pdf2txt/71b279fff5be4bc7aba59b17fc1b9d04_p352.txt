directors and senior management and certain other holders of our ordinary shares, who collectively
held 140,120,987 ordinary shares as of July 26, 2018 have agreed that, subject to certain exceptions,
they will not, from the date of the applicable lock-up agreement until the 90th day after the Listing
Date (the “Lock-Up Period”), offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge, grant any option to purchase,
purchase any option or contract to sell, make any short sale or otherwise dispose of any of the ADSs
or ordinary shares or any of our securities that are substantially similar to the ADSs or ordinary shares,
or any options or warrants to purchase any ADSs or ordinary shares, or any securities convertible into,

these
restrictions expressly preclude such persons from engaging in any hedging or other transaction which
is designed to or which reasonably could be expected to lead to or result in a sale or disposition of
our or such other persons’ ordinary shares, ADSs or other securities even if such ordinary shares,
ADSs or other securities would be disposed of by someone other than such persons. Prohibited
hedging or other transactions includes without limitation any short sale or any purchase, sale or grant
of any right (including without limitation any put or call option) with respect to any of our or such
persons’ ordinary shares, ADSs or other securities or with respect to any security that includes, relates
to, or derives any significant part of its value from such securities.

The restrictions described in the immediately preceding paragraph do not apply to transfers of

such ordinary shares, ADSs or other securities:

acquired in the offering, or transactions relating to the ordinary shares, ADSs or other
securities acquired in open market transactions after the date of the offering;

such beneficiary’s estate) of the locked-up person, provided that any such transfer will not
involve a disposition for value;

(d)
