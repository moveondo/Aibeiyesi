RISK FACTORS

assure you that we will have sufficient cash from other sources to fund our operations. If we resort
to other financing activities to generate additional cash, we will incur financing costs and we cannot
guarantee that we will be able to obtain the financing on terms acceptable to us, or at all, and if we
raise finance by issuing further equity securities your interest in our company may be diluted. If we
have negative operating cash flows in the future, our liquidity and financial condition may be
materially and adversely affected.

We expect to continue to spend substantial amounts on drug discovery, advancing the clinical
development of our drug candidates, commercializing our drugs and launching and commercializing
any drug candidates for which we receive regulatory approval, including building our own commercial
organization to address China and other markets. While we have generated product revenue in China
since September 2017 from sales of our drugs licensed from Celgene, these revenues are not sufficient
to support our operations. Although it is difficult to predict our liquidity requirements, based upon our
current operating plan, we believe that we have sufficient cash, cash equivalents and short-term
investments to meet our projected operating requirements for at least the next 12 months. However,
we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments will not be sufficient
to enable us to complete all global development or commercially launch all of our current drug
candidates for the currently anticipated indications and to invest in additional programs. Accordingly,
we will require further funding through public or private offerings, debt financing, collaboration and
licensing arrangements or other sources. Our forecast of the period of time through which our financial
resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward-looking statement and involves risks
and uncertainties, and actual results could vary as a result of a number of factors, including the factors
discussed elsewhere in this “Risk Factors” section. We have based this estimate on assumptions that
may prove to be wrong, and we could exhaust our available capital resources sooner than we currently
expect. Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including:

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

the progress, timing, scope and costs of our clinical trials, including the ability to timely
enroll patients in our planned and potential future clinical trials;

the outcome, timing and cost of regulatory approvals of our drug candidates;

the number and characteristics of drug candidates that we may in-license and develop;

the amount and timing of the milestone and royalty payments we receive from our
collaborators;

the cost of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other
intellectual property rights;

selling and marketing costs associated with our drugs in China and any future drug
candidates that may be approved, including the cost and timing of expanding our marketing
and sales capabilities;

the terms and timing of any potential future collaborations, licensing or other arrangements
that we may establish;
