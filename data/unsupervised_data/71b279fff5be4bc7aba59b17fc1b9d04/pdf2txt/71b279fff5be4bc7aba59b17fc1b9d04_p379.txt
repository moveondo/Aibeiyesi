Section 40 of the Companies (Winding Up and Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance

For the avoidance of doubt, the Company and all other parties involved in the preparation of this
prospectus acknowledge that each CCASS Participant who gives or causes to give electronic

Personal Data

The section of the Application Form headed “Personal Data” applies to any personal data held
by the Company, the Hong Kong Share Registrar, the receiving bankers, the Joint Global Coordinators,
the Underwriters and any of their respective advisers and agents about you in the same way as it
applies to personal data about applicants other than HKSCC Nominees.

7. WARNING FOR ELECTRONIC APPLICATIONS

The subscription of the Hong Kong Offer Shares by giving electronic application instructions
to HKSCC is only a facility provided to CCASS Participants. Similarly, the application for Hong Kong
Offer Shares through the White Form eIPO service is also only a facility provided by the White Form
eIPO Service Provider to public investors. Such facilities are subject to capacity limitations and
potential service interruptions and you are advised not to wait until the last application day in making
your electronic applications. The Company, the Directors, the Joint Bookrunners, the Joint Sponsors,
the Joint Global Coordinators and the Underwriters take no responsibility for such applications and
provide no assurance that any CCASS Participant or person applying through the White Form eIPO
service will be allotted any Hong Kong Offer Shares.

To ensure that CCASS Investor Participants can give their electronic application instructions,
they are advised not to wait until the last minute to input their instructions to the systems. In the event
that CCASS Investor Participants have problems in the connection to CCASS Phone System/ CCASS
Internet System for submission of electronic application instructions, they should either (i) submit
a WHITE or YELLOW Application Form, or (ii) go to HKSCC’s Customer Service Centre to
complete an input request form for electronic application instructions before 12:00 noon on
Thursday, August 2, 2018, the last day for applications, or such later time as described in “Effect of
Bad Weather on the Opening of the Application Lists” below.
