FINANCIAL INFORMATION

On May 26, 2017, we filed such a shelf registration statement with the SEC for the issuance of an
unspecified amount of ordinary shares (including in the form of ADSs), preferred shares, various
series of debt securities and/or warrants to purchase any of such securities, either individually or in
units, from time to time at prices and on terms to be determined at the time of any such offering. This
registration statement was effective upon filing and will remain in effect for up to three years from
filing. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt
securities, the ownership interest of our shareholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities
may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a holder of ADSs or
ordinary shares. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting
or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital
expenditures or declaring dividends and may require the issuance of warrants, which could potentially
dilute your ownership interest. If we raise additional funds through collaboration agreements, strategic
alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our
technologies, future revenue streams or research programs or to grant licenses on terms that may not
be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings,
collaborations or other sources when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate
our product development or commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market products
or drug candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.
