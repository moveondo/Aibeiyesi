SUMMARY

Sales and Marketing

We have no internally-developed products approved for commercial sale. In connection with our
strategic collaboration with Celgene, we were granted an exclusive license in China, excluding Hong
Kong, Macau and Taiwan, to commercialize Celgene’s approved cancer therapies, ABRAXANE威,
REVLIMID威 and VIDAZA威. We rely on an independent third-party distributor for the distribution and
our internal sales team for the sales and marketing of these products. In anticipation of our business
expansion and as our internally-developed drugs become available for sale, if approved, we plan to
further expand our sales and marketing force in the next few years. See “Business — Sales and
Marketing” for the effects of the PRC regulations on the prices of our commercial products.

Competitive Landscape

The tables below summarize the China competitive landscape of our core pipeline agents and

ABRAXANE威, REVLIMID威 and VIDAZA威, according to the Frost & Sullivan Report.

BTK Competitive Landscape in China (Late-Stage)

Mechanism: Bruton’s tyrosine kinase plays a role in signaling through the B-cell surface receptors which results in activation of
pathways necessary for B-cell trafficking, chemotaxis, and adhesion. Nonclinical studies show that BTK inhibition could inhibit

malignant B-cell proliferation and survival.
