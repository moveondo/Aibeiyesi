THE COMPANIES (WINDING UP AND MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS) ORDINANCE

WAIVER AND EXEMPTION IN RELATION TO THE 2011 OPTION PLAN AND THE 2016
SHARE OPTION AND INCENTIVE PLAN

Rule 17.02(1)(b) of, and paragraph 27 of Appendix 1A to, the Listing Rules, and paragraph 10(d)
of Part I of the Third Schedule to the Companies (Winding Up and Miscellaneous Provisions)
Ordinance, requires the Company to disclose, among other things, details of the number, description
and amount of any shares in or debentures of our Company which any person has, or is entitled to be
given, an option to subscribe for, together with certain particulars of each option, namely the period
during which it is exercisable, the price to be paid for shares or debentures subscribed for under it,
the consideration (if any) given or to be given for it or for the right to it and the names and addresses
of the persons to whom it was given (the “Share Option Disclosure Requirements”).

As of the Latest Practicable Date, our Company had granted options under the 2011 Option Plan
and the 2016 Share Option and Incentive Plan to, respectively, 240 grantees and 724 grantees,
including Directors, senior management and other connected persons of
the Company, other
employees of our Group and other non-employees, to subscribe for an aggregate of respectively,
19,540,593 Shares and 89,606,938 Shares, representing, respectively, 2.55% and 11.68%, of the total
number of Shares in issue immediately after completion of the Global Offering (assuming the
Over-allotment Option is not exercised and no Shares are issued pursuant to our Equity Plans) on the
terms set out in the section headed “Statutory and General Information — Share Option and Award
Schemes” in Appendix IV.

Our Company has applied to the Stock Exchange and the SFC, respectively for, (i) a waiver from
strict compliance with the disclosure requirements under Rule 17.02(1)(b) of, and paragraph 27 of
Appendix 1A to, the Listing Rules; and (ii) a certificate of exemption under section 342A of the
Companies (Winding Up and Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance exempting the Company from
strict compliance with the disclosure requirements under paragraph 10(d) of Part I of the Third
Schedule to the Companies (Winding Up and Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance, on the ground that
strict compliance with the above requirements would be unduly burdensome for our Company for the
following reasons:

Option and Incentive Plan are

requirements in setting out full details of all the grantees under each of the 2011 Option
Plan and the 2016 Share Option and Incentive Plan in the prospectus would be costly and
unduly burdensome for the Company in light of a significant increase in cost and timing for
information compilation, prospectus preparation and printing;

the 2016 Share Option and Incentive Plan, 3 grantees and 13 grantees, respectively, were
