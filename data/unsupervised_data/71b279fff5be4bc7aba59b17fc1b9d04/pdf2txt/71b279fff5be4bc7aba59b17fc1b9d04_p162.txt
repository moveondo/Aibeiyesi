INDUSTRY OVERVIEW

Overview of BTK Inhibitors

BTK is a key component of the B-cell receptor signaling pathway and is an important regulator
of cell proliferation and cell survival in various lymphomas. BTK inhibitors block B-cell receptor, or
BCR, -induced BTK activation and its downstream signaling, leading to growth inhibition and cell
death in B-cells. As of July 18, 2018, there were two marketed BTK inhibitors in the global oncology
drug market, Johnson & Johnson’s IMBRUVICA威 (ibrutinib) and AstraZeneca’s CALQUENCE威
(acalabrutinib). Ibrutinib was first approved by the FDA in 2013 for the treatment of patients with
MCL who have received at least one prior therapy. Since 2013, ibrutinib has received supplemental
FDA approvals for the treatment of patients with CLL, CLL patients with 17p deletion, patients with
WM, patients with marginal zone lymphoma, or MZL, who have received at
least one prior
anti-CD20-based therapy, and patients with chronic graft versus host disease after failure of one or
more lines of systemic therapy. Ibrutinib is also approved by the EMA for the treatment of patients
with MCL, CLL or WM. Ibrutinib has been approved in over 80 countries and regions. Acalabrutinib
was approved by the FDA in October 2017 under accelerated approval for the treatment of patients
with MCL who have received at least one prior therapy. In November 2017, IMBRUVICA威 was
launched in China for relapsed/refractory, or R/R CLL/SLL, and R/R MCL, and it was the only BTK
inhibitor marketed in China as of July 18, 2018.

Historical and Projected Revenues of BTK Inhibitors Globally

In 2017, global revenues for BTK inhibitors reached US$3.2 billion, predominantly from
ibrutinib, growing from US$0.1 billion in 2014. Revenues are projected to increase to US$17.8 billion
by 2030, due to the expansion of clinical indications, the rising penetration rate among cancer patients
and the growth of emerging markets such as China, as shown in the following chart:
