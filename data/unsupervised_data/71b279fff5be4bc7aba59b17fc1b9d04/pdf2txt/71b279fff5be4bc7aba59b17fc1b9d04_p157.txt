The large and growing opportunity for oncology drugs in China is largely attributable to the

following factors:

Large cancer patient population with significant unmet needs: According to Chen et al. 2016,
cancer is the leading cause of death in China, and is a major public health problem. It is estimated that
there were 4.3 million new cancer cases and 2.8 million cancer deaths in China in 2015. Lung,
stomach, liver and esophageal cancers were the four most prevalent cancer types in China in 2015,
which collectively accounted for 57% of all cancer incidence. Lung cancer, liver cancer and gastric
cancer were among the five most prevalent cancer types in Eastern China, Central China and Western
China, respectively in 2014. According to the Frost & Sullivan Report, cancer incidence is expected
to increase to 5.5 million in China in 2030.
