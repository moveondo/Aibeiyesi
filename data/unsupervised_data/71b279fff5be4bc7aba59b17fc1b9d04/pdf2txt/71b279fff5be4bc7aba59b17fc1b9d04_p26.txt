In the event that we receive net proceeds from the Global Offering higher or lower than the
estimated amount stated above (including where we make a Downward Offer Price Adjustment to set
the final Offer Price at HK$85.00 per Offer Share), we will increase or decrease the intended use of
the net proceeds for the above purposes on a pro rata basis (other than the costs associated with the
registration filings,which we expect to remain relatively fixed). In addition, the funds estimated to be
allocated to our clinical programs may differ from what is provided above, based on actual results
from ongoing clinical trials. We expect to incur capital expenditures of approximately US$170.0
million in 2018 and 2019 related to completing our biologics manufacturing facility in Guangzhou. We
currently plan to use our existing cash and short-term investments to fund this project.
