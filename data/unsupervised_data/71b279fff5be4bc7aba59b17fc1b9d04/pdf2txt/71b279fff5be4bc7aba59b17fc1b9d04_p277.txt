The increase in external research and development expense was primarily attributable to the

advancement of our clinical and preclinical pipeline, and included the following:

•

•

Increases of approximately US$0.7 million, US$9.8 million and US$8.5 million,
respectively, for zanubrutinib, tislelizumab and pamiparib, partially offset by a decrease of
approximately US$0.4 million for lifirafenib. The expense increases were primarily due to
the expansion of clinical trials for these candidates, including the initiation or continuation
of pivotal
trials. In addition, external costs of clinical-stage programs include US$10
million of in-process research and development expense related to our in-license of
sitravitinib for the Asia (excluding Japan), Australia and New Zealand territories.

An increase of approximately US$8.7 million in external spending for our preclinical-stage
programs, primarily related to costs associated with advancing our preclinical candidates
toward clinical trials.

The increase in internal research and development expense was primarily attributable to the
expansion of our global development organization and our clinical and preclinical pipeline, and
included the following:

•

US$12.3 million increase of employee salary and benefits, which was primarily attributable
to hiring more research and development personnel to support our expanding research and
clinical activities;
