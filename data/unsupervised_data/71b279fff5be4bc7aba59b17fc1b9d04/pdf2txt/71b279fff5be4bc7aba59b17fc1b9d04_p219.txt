At the time of the data cutoff, 51 patients were evaluable for response, excluding those with less
than 12 weeks of follow-up (n=13) and those with IgM less than 5 g/L at baseline (n=3). Of the 51
patients evaluable for efficacy, 12 were treatment naïve and 39 patients were relapsed or refractory to
prior treatment. The overall response rate, or ORR, was 92% (47/51), and the major response rate was
80%, with 43 percent of patients achieving a very good partial responses, or VGPR, (defined as a
>90% reduction in baseline IgM levels and improvement of extramedullary disease by CT scan). The
12-month progression-free survival (PFS) was estimated at 91%, and the median PFS had not yet been
reached with 16.9 months median follow-up. Median time to response (partial response or higher) was
88 days (range, 77-279). The median IgM decreased from 32.5 g/L (range, 5.3-88.5) at baseline to 4.9
g/L (range, 0.1-57). Of 22 patients with hemoglobin <10 g/dL at baseline, the median increased from
8.7 g/dL (range, 6.3-9.8) to 13.8 g/dL (range, 7.7-15.8). While the presence of MYD88L265P appears
to be associated with response and depth of response with zanubrutinib treatment, significant activity
was also observed in patients with MYD88WT (ORR 83%, major response rate 50%, VGPR rate 17%).

The table below shows the progression-free survival data of WM patients treated with

zanubrutinib:

Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia / Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma

On June 14, 2017 at the 14th International Conference on Malignant Lymphoma in Lugano,
Switzerland, we presented the data in patients with CLL/SLL from the same trial. As of the data cutoff
of March 31, 2017, 69 patients with CLL or SLL (18 treatment naïve, or TN, 51 R/R) were enrolled
in the trial.

Zanubrutinib was shown to be generally well-tolerated in CLL/SLL. The most frequent AEs
(≥10%) of any attribution were petechiae/purpura/contusion (46%), fatigue (29%), upper respiratory
tract infection (28%), cough (23%), diarrhea (22%), headache (19%), hematuria (15%), nausea (13%),
