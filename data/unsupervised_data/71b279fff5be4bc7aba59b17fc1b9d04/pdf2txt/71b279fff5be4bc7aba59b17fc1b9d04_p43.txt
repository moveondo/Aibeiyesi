GLOSSARY OF TECHNICAL TERMS

PD-L1

PI3K

Pivotal trials/programs

RAF

RAF dimer

Relapsed/refractory (R/R)

SEER

SCC

SLL

Means programmed death-ligand 1, a protein in humans
encoded by the CD274 gene. PD-L1 binds the PD-1 receptor
and sends an inhibitory signal inside the T-cell, stopping it
from making more poisonous proteins and killing the cells
that send the signal via PD-L1 and in the neighborhood

Means one or more phosphoinositide 3-kinase enzymes,
which are part of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, an important
signaling pathway for many cellular functions such as growth
control, metabolism and translation initiation

Means a potentially registration-enabling trial or program that
is intended to provide clinical data to support a regulatory
approval for marketing the drug candidate

Means Rapidly Accelerated Fibrosarcoma. RAF kinases are a
family of three serine/threonine-specific protein kinases that
are related to retroviral oncogenes. RAF kinases participate in
the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK MAPK pathway

Means a protein complex formed by two copies of RAF
proteins. This
a
BRAF-CRAF complex, or a CRAF-CRAF complex

a BRAF-BRAF complex,

could

be

Relapsed means patients initially respond to treatment but
then cancer returns after a period of remission; refractory
means cancer/tumor did not respond to treatment

Means Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results

Means squamous cell carcinoma

Means small lymphocytic lymphoma

Stable Disease (SD)

Means cancer that
extent or severity

is neither decreasing nor increasing in

T-cell

TIM-3

Means a type of white blood cell that play a large role in
immune response and that differs from other white blood cells
like B-cells by the presence of the T-cell receptor on the
T-cell’s outer surface, which is responsible for recognizing
antigens
