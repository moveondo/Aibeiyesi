Under US GAAP, the Group has elected to recognize compensation expense using the straight line method for all
employee equity awards granted with graded vesting based on service conditions provided that
the amount of
compensation cost recognized at any date is at least equal to the portion of the grant-date value of the options that are
vested at that date.

Under IFRSs, the accelerated method is required to recognize compensation expense for all employee equity awards
granted with graded vesting.

Hence difference of US$35,987,000 (year ended December 31, 2016: US$7,681,000) arose between the amount of share
based compensation (included in research and development expenses, and selling, general and administrative expenses)
and related income tax impact of US$3,913,000 (year ended December 31, 2016: US$1,271,000) recognized under US
GAAP and IFRS in the year ended December 31, 2017. In addition, difference of US$2,379,000 arose between the amount
of accumulated share based compensation recognized in opening additional paid in capital and opening accumulated
losses under US GAAP and IFRSs as at January 1, 2016,
the beginning of the Relevant Periods. No material
consequential impact on income tax arose for the periods prior to the beginning of the Relevant Periods. Consequential
impact on non-controlling interest of US$38,000 arose for the year ended December 31, 2017 but no consequential
impact on non-controlling interest arose for the year ended December 31, 2016 and earlier financial years. The overall
net impact on the net loss attributable to BeiGene, Ltd. was US$32,036,000 and US$6,410,000 for the year ended
December 31, 2017 and 2016 respectively.

Similarly, difference of US$10,912,000 and US$4,996,000 arose between the amount of share based compensation
recognized under US GAAP and IFRSs in the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 respectively, and related
income tax impact of US$ nil and US$1,116,000 arose for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 respectively.
Related income tax impact under IFRSs is nil for the three months ended March 31, 2018 because no additional deferred
tax asset can be recognized during such period under IFRSs , which is after taking into account the extent of future
available taxable profit against which the related tax deduction can be utilized.
