Current year and prior year additions include assessment of potential global transfer pricing
adjustments, and U.S. federal and state tax credits and incentives. US$1,182,000 of unrecognized tax
benefits as of March 31, 2018 would impact the consolidated income tax rate if ultimately recognized.
The Group does not anticipate that the amount of existing unrecognized tax benefits will significantly
change within the next 12 months.

The Group has elected to record interest and penalties related to income taxes as a component
of income tax expense. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2017 and the three months ended
March 31, 2017 and 2018, the Group’s accrued interest and penalties, where applicable, related to
uncertain tax positions were not material.
