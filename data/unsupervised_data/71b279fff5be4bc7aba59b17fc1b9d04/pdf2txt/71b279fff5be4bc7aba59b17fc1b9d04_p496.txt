APPENDIX III

SUMMARY OF THE CONSTITUTION OF THE
COMPANY AND CAYMAN COMPANIES LAW

Our shareholders may by special resolution, subject to any confirmation or consent required by
the Companies Law, reduce our share capital or any capital redemption reserve in any manner
permitted by law.

Indemnification of Directors and Executive Officers and Limitation of Liability

Our Articles provide that we shall

indemnify our officers and directors against all actions,
proceedings, costs, charges, expenses, losses, damages or liabilities incurred or sustained by such
directors or officer, other than by reason of such person’s dishonesty, willful default or fraud, in or
about the conduct of our company’s business or affairs (including as a result of any mistake of
judgment) or in the execution or discharge of his duties, powers, authorities or discretions, including
without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, any costs, expenses, losses or liabilities incurred
by such director or officer in defending (whether successfully or otherwise) any civil proceedings
concerning our company or its affairs in any court whether in the Cayman Islands or elsewhere.

Claims Against the Company

Our Articles provide that, unless otherwise determined by a simple majority of our Board in its
sole discretion, consistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties to act
interests of the
company, in the event that (1) any shareholder (the claiming party) initiates or asserts any claim or
counterclaim or joins, offers substantial assistance to or has a direct financial interest in any claim
against our company and (2) the claiming party (or the third party that received substantial assistance
from the claiming party or in whose claim the claiming party had a direct financial interest) does not
obtain a judgment on the merits in which the claiming party prevails, then each claiming party shall,
to the fullest extent permissible by law, be obligated jointly and severally to reimburse us for all fees,
costs and expenses (including, but not limited to, all reasonable attorneys’ fees and other litigation
expenses) that we may incur in connection with such claim.

Our Articles provide that, subject to limited exceptions, the courts of Cayman Islands will be the
sole and exclusive forum for (1) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (2) any
action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other
employees to us or our shareholders, (3) any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to
any provision of the Companies Law or the Articles of Association, or (4) any other action asserting
a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine (as such concept is recognised under
the laws of the United States).

Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in our share capital shall be
deemed to have notice of and to have consented to the provisions of our Articles of Association
described above. Although we believe these provisions benefit us by providing increased consistency
in the application of Cayman Islands law for the specified types of actions and proceedings, the
