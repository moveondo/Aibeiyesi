APPENDIX I

Fair value of options

ACCOUNTANTS’ REPORT

The binomial option-pricing model was applied in determining the estimated fair value of the
options granted. The model
requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including the
estimated expected stock price volatility and, the exercise multiple for which employees are likely to
exercise share options. For expected volatilities, the trading history and observation period of the
Company’s own share price movement have not been long enough to match the life of the share option.
Therefore, the Company has made reference to the historical price volatilities of ordinary shares of
several comparable companies in the same industry as the Company. For the exercise multiple, the
Company was not able to develop an exercise pattern as reference, and thus the exercise multiple is
based on management’s estimation, which the Company believes is representative of the future
exercise pattern of the options. The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option
is based on the U.S. Treasury Bills yield curve in effect at the time of grant. Prior to the completion
of the Company’s US IPO, the estimated fair value of the ordinary shares, at the option grant dates,
was determined with assistance from an independent third-party valuation firm, and the Company’s
management was ultimately responsible for the determination of the estimated fair value of its
ordinary shares. With the completion of the Company’s initial public offering, a public trading market
for the ADSs has been established, and it is no longer necessary for the Company to estimate the fair
value of ordinary shares at the option grant dates.

The following table presents the assumptions used to estimate the fair values of the share options
