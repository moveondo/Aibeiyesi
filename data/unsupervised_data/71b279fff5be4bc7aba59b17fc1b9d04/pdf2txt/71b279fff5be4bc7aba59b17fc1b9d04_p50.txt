RISK FACTORS

authorize us or our investigators to commence a clinical trial or conduct a clinical trial at a prospective
trial site; our inability to reach agreements on acceptable terms with prospective CROs and trial sites,
the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different
CROs and trial sites; manufacturing issues, including problems with manufacturing, supply quality,
compliance with China’s drug Good Manufacturing Practice, or GMP, or obtaining from third parties
sufficient quantities of a drug candidate for use in a clinical trial; clinical trials of our drug candidates
may produce negative or inconclusive results, and we may decide, or regulators may require us, to
conduct additional clinical trials or abandon drug development programs; the number of patients
required for clinical trials of our drug candidates may be larger than we anticipate, enrollment may
be insufficient or slower than we anticipate or patients may drop out at a higher rate than we
anticipate; our third-party contractors,
to comply with
regulatory requirements or meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner, or at all; we
might have to suspend or terminate clinical trials of our drug candidates for various reasons, including
a finding of a lack of clinical response or other unexpected characteristics or a finding that participants
are being exposed to unacceptable health risks; regulators, IRBs or ethics committees may require that
we or our investigators suspend or terminate clinical research or not rely on the results of clinical
research for various reasons,
the cost of
clinical trials of our drug candidates may be greater than we anticipate; and the supply or quality of
our drug candidates, companion diagnostics or other materials necessary to conduct clinical trials of
our drug candidates may be insufficient or inadequate.

including noncompliance with regulatory requirements;

including clinical

investigators, may fail

If we are required to conduct additional clinical trials or other testing of our drug candidates
beyond those that we currently contemplate, if we are unable to successfully complete clinical trials
of our drug candidates or other testing, if the results of these trials or tests are not positive or are only
modestly positive or if they raise safety concerns, we may:

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

be delayed in obtaining regulatory approval for our drug candidates;

not obtain regulatory approval at all;

obtain approval for indications that are not as broad as intended;

have the drug removed from the market after obtaining regulatory approval;

be subject to additional post-marketing testing requirements;

be subject to restrictions on how the drug is distributed or used; or

be unable to obtain reimbursement for use of the drug.

Significant clinical trial delays may also increase our development costs and could shorten any
periods during which we have the exclusive right to commercialize our drug candidates or allow our
competitors to bring drugs to market before we do. This could impair our ability to commercialize our
drug candidates and may harm our business and results of operations.
