RISK FACTORS

The trading prices of our ordinary shares and/or ADSs can be volatile, which could result in
substantial losses to you.

The trading price of our ordinary shares and/or ADSs can be volatile and fluctuate widely in
response to a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. In addition, the performance
and fluctuation of the market prices of other companies with business operations located mainly in the
PRC that have listed their securities in Hong Kong or the United States may affect the volatility in
the price of and trading volumes for our ordinary shares and/or ADSs. Some of these companies have
experienced significant volatility. The trading performances of these PRC companies’ securities may
affect the overall investor sentiment towards other PRC companies listed in Hong Kong or the United
States and consequently may impact the trading performance of our ordinary shares and/or ADSs.

In addition to market and industry factors, the price and trading volume for our ordinary shares
and/or ADSs may be highly volatile for specific business reasons,
including: announcements of
regulatory approval or a complete response letter, or specific label indications or patient populations
for its use, or changes or delays in the regulatory review process; announcements of therapeutic
innovations, new products, acquisitions, strategic relationships, joint ventures or capital commitments
by us or our competitors; adverse actions taken by regulatory agencies with respect to our clinical
trials, manufacturing supply chain or sales and marketing activities; any adverse changes to our
relationship with manufacturers or suppliers; the results of our testing and clinical trials; the results
of our efforts to acquire or license additional drug candidates; variations in the level of expenses
related to our existing drugs and drug candidates or preclinical, clinical development and
commercialization programs; any intellectual property infringement actions in which we may become
involved; announcements concerning our competitors or the pharmaceutical
industry in general;
fluctuations in product revenue, sales and marketing expenses and profitability; manufacture, supply
or distribution shortages; variations in our results of operations; announcements about our results of
operations that are not in line with analyst expectations, the risk of which is enhanced because it is
our policy not to give guidance on results of operations; publication of operating or industry metrics
by third parties, including government statistical agencies, that differ from expectations of industry
or financial analysts; changes in financial estimates by securities research analysts; media reports,
whether or not true, about our business; additions to or departures of our management; fluctuations
of exchange rates between the RMB, the U.S. dollar and Hong Kong dollar; release or expiry of
lock-up or other transfer restrictions on our outstanding ordinary shares or ADSs; sales or perceived
potential sales of additional ordinary shares or ADSs by us, our executive officers and Directors or
our shareholders; general economic and market conditions and overall fluctuations in the U.S. or Hong
Kong equity markets; changes in accounting principles; and changes or developments in the PRC or
global regulatory environment.

In addition, the stock market, in general, and pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have
experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate
to the operating performance of these companies. Broad market and industry factors may negatively
affect
the market price of the ordinary shares and/or ADSs, regardless of our actual operating
performance. Further, the current volatility in the financial markets and related factors beyond our
control may cause the ordinary share and/or ADS price to decline rapidly and unexpectedly.
