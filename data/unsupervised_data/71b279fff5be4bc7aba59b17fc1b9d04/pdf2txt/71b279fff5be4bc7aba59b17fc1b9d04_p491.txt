APPENDIX III

SUMMARY OF THE CONSTITUTION OF THE
COMPANY AND CAYMAN COMPANIES LAW

Any dividend unclaimed after a period of six years from the date of declaration of such dividend

may be forfeited by the Board and, if so forfeited, shall revert to the Company.

Voting Rights

Each ordinary share is entitled to one vote on all matters upon which the ordinary shares are

entitled to vote.

Voting at any meeting of shareholders is by poll.

An ordinary resolution to be passed by the shareholders requires the affirmative vote of a simple
majority of the votes cast by the shareholders entitled to vote who are present in person or by proxy
at a general meeting, while a special resolution requires the affirmative vote of at least two-third of
the votes cast by the shareholders entitled to vote who are present in person or by proxy at a general
meeting (except for certain types of winding up of the company, in which case the required majority
to pass a special resolution shall be 100%). Both ordinary resolutions and special resolutions may also
be passed by a unanimous written resolution signed by all
the shareholders of our company, as
permitted by the Companies Law and our Articles. A special resolution will be required for important
matters such as a change of name and amendments to our Articles. Our shareholders may effect certain
changes by ordinary resolution,
including increasing the amount of our authorised share capital,
consolidating and dividing all or any of our share capital into shares of larger amounts than our
existing shares and cancelling any authorised but unissued shares.

Transfer of Ordinary Shares

Subject to the restrictions contained in our Articles, any of our shareholders may transfer all or
any of his or her ordinary shares by an instrument of transfer in any usual or common form or any
other form approved by our Board, executed by or on behalf of the transferor (and, if in respect of a
nil or partly paid up share, or if so required by our directors, by or on behalf of the transferee).

Our board of directors may, in its absolute discretion, decline to register any transfer of any
ordinary share that has not been fully paid up or is subject to a company lien. Our Board may also
decline to register any transfer of any ordinary share unless:

•

•

•

•

•

the instrument of transfer is lodged with us, accompanied by the certificate for the ordinary
shares to which it relates and such other evidence as our Board may reasonably require to
show the right of the transferor to make the transfer;

the instrument of transfer is in respect of only one class of ordinary shares;

the instrument of transfer is properly stamped, if required;

the ordinary share transferred is fully paid and free of any lien in favour of us;

any fee related to the transfer has been paid to us; and
