New drugs that have obtained the approval for NDA must wait until the next NRDL revision
window before submitting the application for inclusion into the NRDL. Since 2000, updates to the
NRDL have been less frequent. The latest version of the NRDL issued in February 2017, or NRDL
2017, started expanding the reimbursement for cancer drugs.

BTK INHIBITOR MARKET LANDSCAPE

Overview of Lymphomas

lymphomas can also be characterized as either B- or T-cell

Lymphomas are blood-borne cancers involving lymphatic cells of the immune system. They can
be broadly categorized into non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas, or NHL and HL. Depending on the origin of
the cancer cells,
lymphomas. B-cell
lymphomas make up approximately 85% of NHLs and comprise a variety of specific diseases
involving B-cells at differing stages of maturation or differentiation. According to statistics from the
Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results, or SEER, program of the U.S. National Cancer Institute,
there were 72,240 new NHL cases and 20,140 deaths, and 20,110 new chronic lymphocytic leukemia,
or CLL, cases and 4,660 deaths in 2017 in the United States. In China, according to GLOBOCAN 2012
analyses on cancer statistics and Chen et al. 2016, there are an estimated 42,000 to 88,000 new
lymphoma cases and 26,000 to 53,000 deaths each year.

Conventional methods of treating lymphomas vary according to the specific disease or histology,
but generally include chemotherapy, antibodies directed at CD20, and,
less frequently, radiation.
Recently, significant progress has been made in the development of new therapies for lymphomas,
including BTK inhibitors, PI3K inhibitors,
idelalisib and copanlisib and the Bcl-2 inhibitor,
venetoclax. Most recently, a cell-based therapy, YESCARTA威, was approved for the treatment of
diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, or DLBCL. YESCARTA威 is a CD-19 directed genetically modified
autologous T-cell immuno-oncology therapy.
