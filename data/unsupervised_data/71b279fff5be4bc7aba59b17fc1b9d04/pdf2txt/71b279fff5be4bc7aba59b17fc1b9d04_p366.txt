Company and the Stock Exchange at www.beigene.com and www.hkexnews.hk, respectively, notices
of the reduction. Upon the issue of such a notice, the revised number of Offer Shares and/or the Offer
Price range will be final and conclusive and the Offer Price, if agreed upon by the Joint Global
Coordinators (on behalf of the Underwriters) and the Company, will be fixed within such revised Offer
Price Range. If the number of Offer Shares and/or the Offer Price range is so reduced, all applicants
who have already submitted an application will need to confirm their applications in accordance with
the procedures set out in the supplemental prospectus and all unconfirmed applications will not be
valid.

Before submitting applications for the Hong Kong Offer Shares, applicants should have regard
to the possibility that any announcement of a reduction in the number of Offer Shares and/or the Offer
Price range may not be made until the last day for lodging applications under the Hong Kong Public
Offering. Such notice will also include confirmation or revision, as appropriate, of the working capital
statement and the Global Offering statistics as currently set out in this prospectus, and any other
financial information which may change as a result of any such reduction. In the absence of any such
notice so published, the number of Offer Shares will not be reduced and/or the Offer Price, if agreed
upon by the Joint Global Coordinators (on behalf of the Underwriters) and the Company, will under
no circumstances be set outside the Offer Price Range as stated in this prospectus.

The final Offer Price, the level of indications of interest in the International Placing, the level
of applications in the Hong Kong Public Offering, the basis of allocations of the Hong Kong Offer
Shares and the results of allocations in the Hong Kong Public Offering are expected to be made
available through a variety of channels in the manner described in the section headed “How to Apply
for Hong Kong Offer Shares — Publication of Results” in this prospectus.
