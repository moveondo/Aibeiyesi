Market Opportunity and Competition

Lymphomas are blood-borne cancers involving lymphatic cells of the immune system. They can
be broadly categorized into NHL and HL. Depending on the origin of the cancer cells, lymphomas can
also be characterized as B-cell or T-cell lymphomas. B-cell lymphomas make up approximately 85%
of NHLs and comprise a variety of specific diseases involving B-cells at differing stages of maturation
or differentiation. According to statistics from the SEER program of the U.S. National Cancer
Institute, there were 72,240 new NHL cases and 20,140 deaths, and 20,110 new CLL, cases and 4,660
deaths in 2017 in the United States. According to a published study (Chen et al., Cancer Statistics in
China, 2015, CA Cancer J. Clin. 2016; 66(2):115-32), which we refer to as Chen et al. 2016, and
GLOBOCAN 2012 analyses on cancer statistics in China, there are an estimated 42,000 to 88,000 new
lymphoma cases and 26,000 to 53,000 deaths in China each year.

Conventional methods of treating lymphomas vary according to the specific disease or histology,
but generally include chemotherapy, antibodies directed at CD20, and,
less frequently, radiation.
Recently, significant progress has been made in the development of new therapies for lymphomas,
including BTK inhibitors, PI3K inhibitors, idelalisib, copanlisib and the Bcl-2 inhibitor, venetoclax.
Most recently, a cell-based therapy, YESCARTA威, was approved for the treatment of diffuse large
B-cell lymphoma, or DLBCL. YESCARTA威 is a CD 19 directed genetically modified autologous T-cell
immuno-oncology therapy.
