Combination with GAZYVA威 (obinutuzumab)

We are also evaluating zanubrutinib in combination with GAZYVA威 (obinutuzumab), an
approved anti-CD20 antibody therapy, in patients with B-cell lymphoma in an open label, multi-center
Phase 1b trial in Australia, the United States and South Korea. On December 9, 2017, we presented
updated preliminary clinical data from this trial at the 59th ASH Annual Meeting in Atlanta, GA. As
of the data cutoff of September 15, 2017, 45 patients with CLL/SLL and 26 patients with FL were
enrolled in the trial. The preliminary Phase 1b data demonstrated that the combination was generally
well-tolerated and was highly active in patients with FL and TN or R/R CLL/SLL.

At the time of data cutoff, the most common AEs were grades 1 and 2. The most common AEs
in
attribution were
patients with CLL/SLL (occurring
petechiae/purpura/contusion (42%), neutropenia (40%), upper
infection (36%),
fatigue (24%), thrombocytopenia (24%), diarrhea (20%) and pyrexia (20%). The most common AEs
in patients with FL (occurring in ≥ 20% of patients) of any attribution were upper respiratory tract
infection (38%), petechia/purpura/contusion (35%), rash (27%) and thrombocytopenia (23%). Grade
3 or 4 AEs of any attribution reported in ≥ 5% of the CLL/SLL patients included neutropenia (24%)
and thrombocytopenia (7%). Grade 3 or 4 AEs of any attribution reported in ≥ 5% of the FL patients
included neutropenia (12%). There were no cases of serious hemorrhage, which is ≥ grade 3
hemorrhage or central nervous system hemorrhage of any grade, atrial fibrillation, or grade 3 or above
diarrhea. Only one patient with CLL/SLL discontinued treatment due to an AE, a case of squamous
cell carcinoma, or SCC, who had a prior history of SCC. This was also the only patient in the study
who had a fatal AE.

45 patients with CLL/SLL (20 TN and 25 R/R) and 21 patients with R/R FL were evaluable for
efficacy. In TN CLL/SLL patients, after a median follow-up of 11.4 months (6.0—17.3 months), the
ORR was 95%, with CRs in 35% and PRs in 60% of patients. In R/R CLL/SLL patients, at a median
follow-up time of 12.7 months (7.9—19.5 months), the ORR was 92%, with CRs in 20% and PRs in
72% of patients. In R/R FL patients, at a median follow-up time of 12.1 months (0.8—19.7 months),
the ORR was 76%, with CRs in 38% and PRs in 38% of patients.

Combination with Tislelizumab

We are also evaluating zanubrutinib in combination with our investigational anti-PD1 antibody
tislelizumab. The open-label, multi-center Phase 1b trial
is being conducted in Australia and is
currently in a dose-escalation phase to be followed by a dose-expansion phase. On December 11, 2017,
we presented initial data from the ongoing Phase 1b trial at the 59th ASH Annual Meeting in Atlanta,
GA. The initial dose-escalation data suggested that the combination of zanubrutinib and tislelizumab
was generally well-tolerated and exhibited anti-tumor activity in patients with B-cell malignancies. As
of September 15, 2017, 25 patients had been enrolled. There were 13 patients with indolent lymphoma,
including CLL, FL, MZL and WM, and 12 patients with aggressive lymphoma, including DLBCL,
MCL and transformed lymphoma. The median follow-up time was 5.1 months (0.4—14.1 months).
Two cases of autoimmune hemolysis occurred in patients with WM in the dose 2 cohort, and one
