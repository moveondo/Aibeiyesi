Notes:

(i)

Adjustment to recognize the variable consideration of US$16,307,000 under the collaboration arrangement with Celgene
Corporation as revenue in the Group’s consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017 upon the
early adoption of ASC 606 — Revenue from Contracts with Customers in preparing the Historical Financial Information.
This is because such variable consideration related to Celgene’s opt-in of certain clinical trials of the Group was not
constrained, which meets with the revenue recognition criteria of ASC 606.

(ii)

Adjustment to charge the PRC withholding tax of US$26,090,000 incurred on intragroup transfer of the 100% equity
interest in BeiGene Shanghai to BeiGene Guangzhou as an expense in the Group’s consolidated statement of operations
for the year ended December 31, 2017 upon the early adoption of ASU 2016-16 in preparing the Historical Financial
Information.

Prior to the early adoption of ASU 2016-16, such PRC withholding tax arising from intragroup transfer of equity interest
was deferred and carried in the Group’s consolidated balance sheet as a prepaid asset as at December 31, 2017 under ASC
740.

(iii) Adjustment to recognize the government subsidies of US$9,990,000 relating to the above mentioned PRC withholding
tax as income in the Group’s consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 as a result of
the early adoption of ASU 2016-16 to recognize such PRC withholding tax as an expense in 2017. In addition, the income
tax expense of US$2,498,000 on the government subsidies previously deferred as a prepaid asset under ASC 740 is
charged as an expense in the Group’s consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 as a
result of the recognition of such government subsidies as income in 2017. Finally, adjustments are made in the Group’s
consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017 to account for the consequential impact on the
Group’s non-controlling interests of US$375,000 and a foreign currency translation difference of US$263,000 arising
from the above adjustments of government subsidies and related income tax expense which are applicable to a
non-wholly-owned PRC subsidiary.

No early adoption adjustments were applicable to (i) the previously published consolidated financial statements of the Group
for the year ended December 31, 2016; and (ii) the previously published consolidated condensed financial statements of the
Group for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017.
