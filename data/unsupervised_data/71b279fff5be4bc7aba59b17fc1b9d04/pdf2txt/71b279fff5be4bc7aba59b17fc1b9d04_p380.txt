HOW TO APPLY FOR HONG KONG OFFER SHARES

8.

HOW MANY APPLICATIONS CAN YOU MAKE

Multiple applications for the Hong Kong Offer Shares are not allowed except by nominees. If you

are a nominee, in the box on the Application Form marked “For nominees” you must include:

•

•

an account number; or

some other identification code,

for each beneficial owner or, in the case of joint beneficial owners, for each joint beneficial owner.
If you do not include this information, the application will be treated as being made for your benefit.

All of your applications will be rejected if more than one application on a WHITE or YELLOW
Application Form or by giving electronic application instructions to HKSCC or through the White
Form eIPO service, is made for your benefit (including the part of the application made by HKSCC
Nominees acting on electronic application instructions). If an application is made by an unlisted
company and:

•

•

the principal business of that company is dealing in securities; and

you exercise statutory control over that company,

then the application will be treated as being for your benefit.

“Unlisted company” means a company with no equity securities listed on the Stock Exchange.

“Statutory control” means you:

•

•

•

control the composition of the Board of the company;

control more than half of the voting power of the company; or

hold more than half of the issued share capital of the company (not counting any part of it
which carries no right to participate beyond a specified amount in a distribution of either
profits or capital).
