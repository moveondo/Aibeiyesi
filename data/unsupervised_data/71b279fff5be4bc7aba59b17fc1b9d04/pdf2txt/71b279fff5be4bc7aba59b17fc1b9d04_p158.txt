Increasingly favorable regulatory framework for innovative drugs that address unmet medical
needs: On October 8, 2017, the General Office of the State Council released Opinions on Reform of
the Drug and Medical Device Review and Approval (“關於深化審評審批制度改革鼓勵藥品醫療器械
創新的意見”). The opinions aim to accelerate drug development and approval and to encourage
innovation within the drug and medical device sectors, as shown in the following chart:

Before

Now

•

Implied  CTA (clinical trial application) approval
(60 days)

• Accepting clinical trial data generated abroad

• Fast track and priority review of  drugs 

addressing medical unmet needs, e.g. cancer

• Enabling conditional approval based on 
surrogate endpoints for drugs addressing 
medical unmet needs, e.g. oncology therapy

• Linked approval of formulation and API, 

excipients and packaging

• Leveraging electronic common technical 

document ( eCTD ) for NDA review

• Accepting foreign clinical data
• Removing restrictions on clinical trials and 

registrations for imported drugs

• Patent linkage system
• Drug patent term compensation system
•
• MAH program

clinical trial 
management

Accelerating 
Review and 

Approval

• Requiring lengthy approval for 

clinical trial applications 
(12-18 months)

• Lengthy review and approval 

process

• Active Pharmaceutical ingredients and
formulations are approved separately  

Realizing Global 

Application

• A drug must be in a Phase II or Phase III 
clinical study or has received marketing 
authorization abroad before it can begin 
an international multi-center trial (“IMCT”) 
in China

Protection of 
Innovators

• Patent declaration system
