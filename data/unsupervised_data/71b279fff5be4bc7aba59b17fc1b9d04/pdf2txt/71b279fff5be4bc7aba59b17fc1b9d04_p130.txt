WAIVERS FROM COMPLIANCE WITH THE LISTING RULES AND EXEMPTIONS FROM

THE COMPANIES (WINDING UP AND MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS) ORDINANCE

EXEMPTION FROM COMPLIANCE WITH PARAGRAPH 27 OF PART I AND PARAGRAPH
31 OF PART II OF THE THIRD SCHEDULE TO THE COMPANIES (WINDING UP AND
MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS) ORDINANCE

According to section 342(1) of the Companies (Winding Up and Miscellaneous Provisions)
Ordinance, this prospectus shall include an accountants’ report which contains the matters specified
in the Third Schedule to the Companies (Winding Up and Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance.

According to paragraph 27 of Part I of the Third Schedule to the Companies (Winding Up and
Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance,
the Company is required to include in the prospectus a
statement as to the gross trading income or sales turnover (as the case may be) of the Company during
each of the three financial years immediately preceding the issue of the prospectus as well as an
explanation of the method used for the computation of such income or turnover and a reasonable
breakdown of the more important trading activities.

According to paragraph 31 of Part II of the Third Schedule to the Companies (Winding Up and
Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance, the Company is required to include in the prospectus a report
prepared by the Company’s auditor with respect to profits and losses and assets and liabilities of the
Company in respect of each of the three financial years immediately preceding the issue of the
prospectus.

According to section 342A(1) of the Companies (Winding Up and Miscellaneous Provisions)
Ordinance, the SFC may issue, subject to such conditions (if any) as the SFC thinks fit, a certificate
of exemption from compliance with the relevant requirements under the Companies (Winding Up and
Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance if, having regard to the circumstances, the SFC considers that
the exemption will not prejudice the interests of the investing public and compliance with any or all
of such requirements would be irrelevant or unduly burdensome, or is otherwise unnecessary or
inappropriate.

According to Rule 4.04(1) of the Listing Rules,

the Accountant’s Report contained in the
prospectus must include, inter alia, the results of the Company in respect of each of the three financial
years immediately preceding the issue of this prospectus or such shorter period as may be acceptable
to the Stock Exchange.

According to Rule 18A.06 of the Listing Rules, an eligible biotech company shall comply with
Rule 4.04 as modified so that references to “three financial years” or “three years” in that rule shall
instead reference to “two financial years” or “two years”, as the case may be. Given that the Company
is required to disclose its financial results for each of the two financial years ended December 31,
2016 and 2017 under Chapter 18A of the Listing Rules and the three months ended March 31, 2018,
it will be unduly burdensome for the Company to comply with the relevant requirements under the
Companies (Winding Up and Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance as stated above.
