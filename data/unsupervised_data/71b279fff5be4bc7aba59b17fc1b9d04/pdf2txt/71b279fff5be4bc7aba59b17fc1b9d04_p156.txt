The treatment of cancer has significantly improved over the last century. Today, major treatments
include surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, targeted therapy and immuno-oncology therapy. The key
milestones in the evolution of cancer treatment are summarized in the diagram below:

Milestones in Cancer Treatment

Targeted Therapy and
Immunotherapy
1997, FDA approves the 
first molecula
rly targeted 
cancer drug, rituximab
2011, FDA approved the 
first checkpoint inhibitor, 
Ipilimuab

•

•

Targeted therapies act on 
specific targets that are 
associated with cancer growth, 
thus they do less harm to normal 
cells. Most targeted therapies are 
either small-molecule drugs or 
monoclonal antibodies.
Immunotherapy induces the
patient's own immune system to 
fight cancer. Immunotherapy 
includes cytokines, monoclonal 
antibodies, checkpoint inhibitors, 
adoptive T-cell therapy and 
cancer vaccines. 

Chemotherapy
1949, FDA approved first 
chemotherapy drug -
nitrogen mustard -for the 
treatment of Hodgkin 
lymphoma

•

•

•

•

Chemotherapy is a cancer 
treatment that uses chemical 
substances, especially one or 
more anti-cancer drugs to stop or 
slow the growth of cancer cells. 
Chemotherapy can be used to 
treat many types of cancer alone 
or in combination with other 
treatments.
Chemotherapy also causes side 
effects such as mouth sores, 
nausea, and hair loss.
Typical chemotherapeutic drugs 
include alkylating agents, 
antimetabolites, anti-tumor 
antibiotics and etc..

Surgery
1881, first successful 
surgery performed for 
stomach cancer

•

•

•

Surgery is a procedure in which 
a surgeon removes cancer from 
patient’s body. 
Surgery works best for solid 
tumors that are contained in one 
area. It is not used for leukemia 
or for cancers that have spread. 
Surgery may be performed before 
or after other forms of treatment.
In addition to removal of the 
primary tumor, surgery is often 
necessary for staging.

Radiotherapy
1903, first successful use 
of radiation to cure skin 
cancer

•

•

•

Radiotherapy is a cancer
treatment that uses high doses of 
radiation to kill cancer cells and 
shrink tumors.
Radiotherapy can be used to treat 
many types of cancer including 
solid tumors and leukemia. And in 
many cases, patients receive 
radiotherapy with other cancer 
treatments, such as surgery and 
chemotherapy.
Radiation not only kills or slows 
the growth of cancer cells, it can 
also affect nearby healthy cells, 
which will cause side effects.
