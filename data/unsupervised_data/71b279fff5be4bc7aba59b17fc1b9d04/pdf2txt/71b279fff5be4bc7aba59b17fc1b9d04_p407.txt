Business combination

The Company accounts for its business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting
in accordance with ASC topic 805 (“ASC 805”): Business Combinations. The acquisition method of
accounting requires all of the following steps: (i) identifying the acquirer, (ii) determining the
acquisition date, (iii) recognizing and measuring the identifiable assets acquired,
the liabilities
assumed, and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and (iv) recognizing and measuring goodwill
or a gain from a bargain purchase. The consideration transferred in a business combination is
measured as the aggregate of the fair values at the date of exchange of the assets given, liabilities
incurred, and equity instruments issued as well as the contingent considerations and all contractual
contingencies as of the acquisition date. The costs directly attributable to the acquisition are expensed
as incurred. Identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired or assumed are measured
separately at
the extent of any
non-controlling interests. The excess of (i) acquisition consideration, fair value of the non-controlling
interests and acquisition date fair value of any previously held equity interest in the acquiree over (ii)
the fair value of the identifiable net assets of the acquiree, is recorded as goodwill. If the cost of
acquisition is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is
recognized directly in the consolidated statements of operations as a gain.
