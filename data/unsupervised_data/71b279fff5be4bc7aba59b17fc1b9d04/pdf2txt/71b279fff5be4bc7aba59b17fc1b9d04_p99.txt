RISK FACTORS

Any failure to comply with PRC regulations regarding our employee equity incentive plans and
investments in offshore companies by PRC residents may subject the PRC plan participants and
PRC-resident beneficial owners or us to fines and other legal or administrative sanctions.

We and our Directors, executive officers and other employees who are PRC residents have
participated in our employee equity incentive plans. We are an overseas listed company, and therefore,
we and our Directors, executive officers and other employees who are PRC citizens or who have
resided in the PRC for a continuous period of not less than one year and who have been granted
restricted share units, restricted shares, options or other forms of equity incentives are subject to the
Notice on Issues Concerning the Foreign Exchange Administration for Domestic Individuals
Participating in Share Incentive Plan of Overseas Publicly Listed Company (《關於境內個人參與境外
上市公司股權激勵計劃外匯管理有關問題的通知》),
employees, directors,
supervisors and other management members participating in any share incentive plan of an overseas
publicly listed company who are PRC citizens or who are non-PRC citizens residing in the PRC for
a continuous period of not less than one year, subject to limited exceptions, are required to register
with SAFE, through a domestic qualified agent, which could be a PRC subsidiary of such overseas
listed company, and complete certain other procedures. We also face regulatory uncertainties that
could restrict our ability to adopt additional equity incentive plans for our Directors and employees
under PRC law.

according to which,

Some of our existing shareholders, each of whom owns our ordinary shares as a result of
exercising share options, are PRC residents under the Circular on Relevant Issues Concerning Foreign
Exchange Control on Domestic Residents’ Offshore Investment and Financing and Roundtrip
Investment through Special Purpose Vehicles (《國家外匯管理局關於境內居民通過特殊目的公司境外
投融資及返程投資外匯管理有關問題的通知》), or SAFE Circular 37. These shareholders have
undertaken to (i) apply to register with local SAFE branch or its delegated commercial bank as soon
as possible after exercising their options, and (ii) indemnify and hold harmless us and our subsidiaries
against any loss suffered arising from their failure to complete the registration. We do not have control
over such shareholders and our other beneficial owners and cannot assure you that all of our
PRC-resident beneficial owners have complied with, and will
in the future comply with, SAFE
Circular 37 and subsequent implementation rules.

If we or our Directors, executive officers or other employees who are PRC citizens or who have
resided in the PRC for a continuous period of not less than one year and who have been granted equity
awards fail
to register the employee equity incentive plans or their exercise of options, or such
PRC-resident beneficial owners fail to register or amend their SAFE registrations in a timely manner
pursuant to SAFE Circular 37, we, such employees and PRC-resident beneficial owners may be subject
to (i) legal or administrative sanctions imposed by the SAFE or other PRC authorities, including fines;
(ii) restrictions on our cross-border investment activities; (iii) limits on the ability of our wholly
owned subsidiaries in China to distribute dividends or the proceeds from any reduction in capital,
share transfer or liquidation to us; and (iv) prohibitions on our ability to inject additional capital into
these subsidiaries. Moreover, failure to comply with the various foreign exchange registration
requirements described above could result in liability under PRC law for circumventing applicable
foreign exchange restrictions.
