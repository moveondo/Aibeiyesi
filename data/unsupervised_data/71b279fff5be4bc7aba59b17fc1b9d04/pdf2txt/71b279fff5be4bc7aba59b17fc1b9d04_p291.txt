Use of Funds

Our primary use of our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments in all periods presented
was to fund our research and development, regulatory and other clinical
trial costs, and related
supporting administration, and since September 2017, to fund our commercial operations in China.
Our prepaid expenses and other current assets, accounts payable and accrued expense balances in all
periods presented were affected by the timing of vendor invoicing and payments, and impacted the
cash provided by, or used in operations. We expect to incur capital expenditures of approximately
US$170 million in 2018 and 2019, to be paid out of existing cash and short-term investments, in
connection with the construction of its biologics manufacturing facility in Guangzhou, Guangdong
Province, PRC.
