“Withdrawal Mechanism”

DEFINITIONS

a mechanism which requires the Company, among other
things, to (a) issue a supplemental prospectus as a result of
material changes in the information (e.g., the Offer Price) in
the prospectus; (b) extend the offer period and allow potential
investors, if they so desire, to confirm their applications using
an opt-in approach (i.e., requiring investors to positively
confirm their applications for shares despite the changes)
