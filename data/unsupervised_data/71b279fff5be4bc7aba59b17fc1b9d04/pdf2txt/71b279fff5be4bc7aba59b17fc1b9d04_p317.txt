if any, shall be determined in our sole
discretion upon consultation with Dr. Wang.

Rules as a pre-revenue biotech company, the revenue ratio under Rule 14.07 of the Listing Rules
would not be an appropriate measure of the size of the transaction under the consulting agreement
relative to our Group. As an alternative, we have applied a percentage ratio test based on the total
expenses of our Group (the “Expense Ratio”).

to the cash component payable to Dr. Wang will not exceed 0.1%. Pursuant

business on normal commercial terms, and our Directors currently expect that each of the applicable
percentage ratios calculated under Chapter 14A of the Listing Rules and the Expense Ratio with
respect
to Rule
14A.76(1)(a) of the Listing Rules, the cash component payable to Dr. Wang under the consulting
agreement will be a fully-exempt continuing connected transaction exempt from the reporting,
announcement and independent shareholders’ approval requirements under Chapter 14A of the Listing
Rules.

Furthermore, with respect to the grant of compensation in the form of share-based incentive
awards to Dr. Wang, if any, we will comply with the applicable requirements under Chapter 14A of
