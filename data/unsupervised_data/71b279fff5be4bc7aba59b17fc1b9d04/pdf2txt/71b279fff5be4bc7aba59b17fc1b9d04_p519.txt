2016 Share Option and Incentive Plan

Summary

The Company will not issue any options under the 2016 Share Option and Incentive Plan, which
was approved by the Board on January 14, 2016 to replace the 2011 Option Plan, until the 2016 Share
Option and Incentive Plan is amended to comply with Chapter 17 of the Listing Rules. The Board is
permitted to make the necessary amendments to the 2016 Share Option and Incentive Plan under the
terms of such plan to comply with Chapter 17 of the Listing Rules and expects to make such
amendments prior to completion of the Global Offering, following which the principal terms of the
2016 Share Option and Incentive Plan are expected to be as set out as described below.

Our 2016 Share Option and Incentive Plan provides us flexibility to use various equity-based
incentive and other awards as compensation tools to motivate our workforce. These tools include share
options, share appreciation rights,
restricted share units, unrestricted shares,
performance share awards, cash-based awards and dividend equivalent rights. The 2016 Share Option
and Incentive Plan became effective on February 2, 2016.

restricted shares,

The maximum number of Shares reserved and available for issuance under the 2016 Share Option
and Incentive Plan and our other Equity Plans may not exceed 10% of the Shares issued and
outstanding as of February 2, 2016 and the aggregate number of Shares that may be issued upon
exercise of all outstanding options granted and yet to be exercised under the 2016 Share Option and
Incentive Plan and outstanding options granted and yet to be exercised under any other plan of the
Company at any time may not exceed 30% of the Shares in issue from time to time. Unless approved
by our shareholders in general meeting, the total number of Shares issued and to be issued upon the
exercise of share options granted and to be granted under the 2016 Share Option and Incentive Plan
and any other plan of the Company to a grantee within any 12-month period shall not exceed 1% of
the Shares in issue at the date of any grant.
