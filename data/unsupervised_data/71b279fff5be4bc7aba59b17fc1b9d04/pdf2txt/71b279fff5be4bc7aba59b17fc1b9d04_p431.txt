APPENDIX I

ACCOUNTANTS’ REPORT

The Group’s trading terms with its customers are mainly on credit and the credit period is
generally three month. The Group seeks to maintain strict control over its outstanding receivables and
overdue balances are regularly reviewed. In view of the fact that the Group’s accounts receivable
substantially relate to a limited number of customers, there is a concentration of credit risk. The Group
does not hold any collateral or other credit enhancements over its accounts receivable balances. Trade
receivables are non-interest-bearing.

An ageing analysis of the trade receivables as at the end of each of the Relevant Periods, based

on the invoice date and net of provisions, is as follows:

Receivables that were neither past due nor impaired relate to customers for whom there was no
recent history of default. Receivables that were past due but not impaired relate to a number of
independent customers that have a good track record with the Group. Based on past experience, the
directors of the Company are of the opinion that no provision for impairment is necessary in respect
of these balances as there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the balances are still
considered fully recoverable.
