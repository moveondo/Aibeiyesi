estimated annual incidence of the top 10 PD-1 responsive tumors is 0.9 million out of 1.7 million in
total annual cancer incidence in the United States, and 0.9 million out of the 1.8 million total in the
EU5 countries according to SEER program of the U.S. National Cancer Institute and the World Health
Organization.

In China, there is only one approved PD-1 antibody agent, Bristol-Myers Squibb’s OPDIVO威
(nivolumab) and there are no approved PD-L1 antibody agents yet. The CDE, under the CDA, released
guidance in February 2018 on the requirements for NDA submissions of PD-1/L1 agents, specifically
for data from single-arm trials on refractory / recurrent advanced cancers without standard-of-care
therapies. A pre-NDA meeting is required before NDA submission, and a rolling NDA submission will
be accepted for PD-1/L1 therapies. On June 15, 2018, the CDA approved Bristol-Myers Squibb’s
OPDIVO威 (nivolumab)
locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC after
platinum-based chemotherapy in adult patients without EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberration.
Merck submitted an NDA for pembrolizumab in February 2018. Among domestic Chinese companies,
Junshi submitted an NDA for JS001 (trepinzumab) in March 2018, and Innovent submitted an NDA
for IBI308 (sintilimab) and Hengrui submitted an NDA for SHR-1210 (camrelizumab) in April 2018.
The table below summarizes the China competitive landscape of tislelizumab, according to the Frost
& Sullivan Report.

PD-1/PD-L1 Competitive Landscape in China (Late-Stage)

Binding of the PD-1 ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, to the PD-1 receptor found on T-cells, inhibits T-cell proliferation and cytokine
production. Upregulation of PD-1 ligands occurs in some tumors and signaling through this pathway can contribute to inhibition

of active T-cell immune surveillance of tumors. Thus, PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor antibodies could inhibit this pathway and

reactivate the T-cell immune surveillance of tumors.
