FINANCIAL INFORMATION

Based on our current operating plan, we expect that our existing cash, cash equivalents and
short-term investments as of March 31, 2018, will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital
expenditures requirements for at least the next 12 months after the date that the financial statements
included in this prospectus are issued. We expect
that our expenses will continue to increase
substantially as we fund our ongoing research and clinical development efforts, including our ongoing
and planned pivotal trials for zanubrutinib, tislelizumab and pamiparib, both in China and globally;
our other ongoing and planned clinical trials; regulatory filing and registration of our late-stage drug
candidates; expansion of commercial operations in China and preparation for launch of our drug
candidates globally; business development and manufacturing activities; and working capital and
other general corporate purposes. We have based our estimates on assumptions that may prove to be
wrong, and we may use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. Because of
the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization of our
drug candidates, we are unable to estimate the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating
expenditures necessary to complete the development and commercialization of our drug candidates.

Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory reviews and approvals;

the ability of our drug candidates to progress through clinical development successfully;

the initiation, progress, timing, costs and results of nonclinical studies and clinical trials for
our other programs and potential drug candidates;

the number and characteristics of the drug candidates we pursue;

the costs of establishing commercial manufacturing capabilities or securing necessary
supplies from third-party manufacturers;

the costs of preparing,
enforcing our
claims;

filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and
intellectual property rights and defending intellectual property-related

the costs of establishing and expanding our commercial operations and the success of those
operations;

the extent to which we acquire or in-license other products and technologies; and

our ability to maintain and establish collaboration arrangements on favorable terms, if at
all.

Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenue, we expect to finance our
cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaboration agreements,
strategic alliances, licensing arrangements, government grants and other available sources. Under SEC
rules, we currently qualify as a “well-known seasoned issuer,” which allows us to file shelf
registration statements to register an unspecified amount of securities that are effective upon filing.
