WAIVERS FROM COMPLIANCE WITH THE LISTING RULES AND EXEMPTIONS FROM

THE COMPANIES (WINDING UP AND MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS) ORDINANCE

Accordingly, we applied to the SFC for, and the SFC has granted, a certificate of exemption from
strict compliance with the requirements under paragraph 27 of Part I and paragraph 31 of Part II of
the Third Schedule to the Companies (Winding Up and Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance on the
following grounds:

(a)

(b)

(c)

our Company is primarily engaged in the research and development, application and
commercialisation of biotech products, and falls within the scope of biotech company as
defined under Chapter 18A of the Listing Rules;

the Accountant’s Report for each of the two financial years ended December 31, 2016 and
2017 and the three months ended March 31, 2018 has been prepared and is set out in
Appendix I to this prospectus in accordance with Rule 18A.06 of the Listing Rules;

notwithstanding that the financial results set out in this prospectus are only for the two
years ended December 31, 2016 and 2017 in accordance with Chapter 18A of the Listing
Rules and the three months ended March 31, 2018, other information required to be
disclosed under the Listing Rules and requirements under the Companies (Winding up and
Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance has been adequately disclosed in this prospectus
pursuant to the relevant requirements.

Our Company is of the view that

the Accountant’s Report covering the two years ended
December 31, 2016 and 2017 and the three months ended March 31, 2018,
together with other
disclosure in this prospectus, has already provided the potential
investors with adequate and
reasonably up-to-date information in the circumstances to form a view on the track record of our
Company; and our Directors confirm that all information which is necessary for the investing public
to make an informed assessment of the business, assets and liabilities, financial position, management
and prospects has been included in this prospectus. Therefore, the exemption would not prejudice the
interests of the investing public.

PLACINGS TO CONNECTED PERSONS

The Company has a number of products ranging from early (Phase 1a) products to later stage
(Phase 3) products, which will necessitate significant ongoing financing over a more than five year
period prior to their potential commercialization. Efficient access to capital on a continuing basis is
therefore essential to funding the Company’s business plans, and participation in capital raisings by
biotech focused funds with deep industry knowledge (such as the Existing Shareholders) is often
crucial to their success.

We have therefore applied for, and the Stock Exchange has agreed to grant, a waiver from strict
compliance with Rule 13.36(1) of the Listing Rules and the independent shareholder approval
requirements set out in Chapter 14A of the Listing Rules in respect of issuances of the Company’s
shares to the Existing Shareholders to the extent they are our connected persons during the initial
five-year period after the Next GM with such five-year period subject to an extension on a rolling
basis each subsequent year such that assuming the shareholders vote in favour of all relevant
