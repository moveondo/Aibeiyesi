Operating Activities

Operating activities used US$104.5 million of cash in the three months ended March 31, 2018,
which resulted principally from our net loss of US$105.1 million and an increase in our net operating
assets and liabilities of US$26.5 million, offset by non-cash charges of US$27.1 million. The overall
increase in our net operating assets was primarily due to an increase in unbilled receivables of US$7.6
million related to the Celgene collaboration, an increase of US$13.8 million in prepaid expenses and
other current assets primarily related to prepayments to CROs for clinical trials, an increase of US$2.1
million in other non-current assets primarily related to rental deposits and other, a decrease of
US$12.4 million in accounts payable and accrued expenses related to payments for external research
and development costs, payroll-related costs and selling, general and administrative expenses to
support our growing business, offset by an decrease in accounts receivable of US$5.9 million related
to collections on product sales from our collaboration with Celgene, and a decrease of US$3.4 million
in inventories. Our non-cash charges and other adjustments to our net loss during the three months

US$10.0 million of acquired in-process research and development related to the license agreement

non-cash charges during the three months ended March 31, 2017 primarily consisted of US$6.0 million
of share-based compensation expense and US$0.9 million of depreciation expense, partially offset by
$2.2 million of deferred income tax benefits.

During the year ended December 31, 2017, operating activities provided US$12.8 million of
cash, due to cash inflows of US$250.0 million from upfront license fees received from Celgene, and
decreases in net working capital offsetting significantly increased total expenses, adjusted for
non-cash expenses. The overall decrease in our net operating assets was primarily due to an increase
in deferred revenue of US$37.0 million related to the Celgene collaboration, an increase of US$80.3

related to government grants received, offset by an increase in accounts receivable of US$29.4 million
