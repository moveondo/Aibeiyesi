determined based on its intrinsic value, which equaled the difference between the share price at the
US IPO closing date and the exercise price of such purchased ordinary shares. During the years ended
December 31, 2016 and 2017 and the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2018, the Group
recognized a loss from the increase in fair value of the Option of US$1,151,000, nil, nil and nil,
respectively.

Warrants in connection with the convertible promissory notes

During the years ended December 31, 2012 to 2014, the Company entered into agreements with
several investors to issue convertible promissory notes (converted into preferred shares in year 2014,
details set out in note II.30), and related warrants to purchase the Company’s preferred shares up to
10% of the convertible promissory notes’ principal amount concurrently, for an aggregate principal
amount of US$2,410,000. The warrants were freestanding instruments and were recorded as liabilities
in accordance with ASC480. The warrants were initially recognized at fair value with subsequent
changes in fair value recorded in losses. In January 2016 and February 2016, the warrants issued in
connection with the promissory notes were exercised for 621,637 preferred shares, which were then
converted into 621,637 ordinary shares. Hence the balance of warrants became nil as at December 31,
2016. As the exercise dates were very close to the US IPO closing date, the respective exercise date
fair value of the warrants of US$1,148,000 was determined based on the intrinsic value, which equaled
the difference between the share price at the US IPO closing date and the exercise price of the issued
warrants. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2017 and the three months ended March 31,
2017 and 2018, the Group recognized a loss from the increase in fair value of warrants of US$363,000,
nil, nil and nil, respectively.
