The increase in external research and development expense was primarily attributable to the

advancement of our clinical and preclinical drug candidates, and included the following:

•

•

Increases of approximately US$40.1 million, US$27.1 million and US$12.9 million,
respectively, for zanubrutinib, tislelizumab and pamiparib, partially offset by a decrease of
approximately US$3.0 million for lifirafenib. The expense increases were primarily due to
the expansion of clinical trials for these candidates, including the initiation or continuation
of pivotal trials; and

Approximately US$3.2 million increase in external spending for our preclinical-stage
programs, primarily related to costs associated with advancing our preclinical candidates
toward clinical trials.

The increase in internal research and development expense was primarily attributable to the
expansion of our development organization and our clinical and preclinical pipeline, and included the
following:

•

•

US$33.8 million increase of employee salary and benefits, which was primarily attributable
to hiring more research and development personnel to support our expanding research and
clinical activities;

US$22.5 million increase of share-based compensation expense, primarily attributable to
our increased headcount, as well as the increased valuation of non-employee equity
compensation grants due to a higher share price;
