Our Clinical-Stage Drug Candidates

Zanubrutinib (BGB-3111), a Bruton’s Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor

Zanubrutinib is an investigational small molecule inhibitor of Bruton’s tyrosine Kinase, or BTK,
that is currently being evaluated in a broad pivotal clinical program globally and in China as a
monotherapy and in combination with other therapies to treat various lymphomas. Zanubrutinib has
demonstrated higher selectivity against BTK than IMBRUVICA威 (ibrutinib), an approved BTK
inhibitor, based on our biochemical assays, higher exposure than ibrutinib based on their respective
Phase 1 experience in separate studies, and sustained 24-hour BTK occupancy in both the peripheral
blood and lymph node compartments.

Tislelizumab (BGB-A317), a PD-1 Antibody

Tislelizumab is an investigational humanized monoclonal antibody against

the immune
checkpoint receptor PD-1 that is currently being evaluated in pivotal clinical trials globally and in
China and for which we plan to commence additional pivotal
trials as a monotherapy and in
combination with standard of care to treat various solid and hematological cancers. Tislelizumab is
designed to bind to and block downstream activity of PD-1, a cell surface receptor that plays an
important
role in downregulating the immune system by preventing the activation of T-cells.
Tislelizumab has high affinity and specificity for PD-1. It is differentiated from the currently approved
PD-1 antibodies by an engineered Fc region, which we believe may minimize potentially negative
interactions with other
immune cells based on preclinical data. We have a global strategic
collaboration with Celgene for tislelizumab for solid tumors outside of Asia (other than Japan) as
further described in “Business—Collaboration Agreements—Celgene.”
