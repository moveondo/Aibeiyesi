BUSINESS

Merck KGaA, Darmstadt Germany

Pamiparib

On October 28, 2013, we entered into license agreements with Merck KGaA, Darmstadt
Germany, which we refer to respectively as the Ex-PRC PARP Agreement and the PRC PARP
Agreement, pursuant to which (a) we granted to Merck KGaA, Darmstadt Germany an exclusive
license under certain of our intellectual property rights to develop and manufacture, and, if Merck
KGaA, Darmstadt Germany exercised a continuation option,
to commercialize and manufacture
pamiparib and any other compound covered by the same existing patent rights with primary activity
to inhibit PARP 1, 2 or 3 enzymes, or the Licensed PARP Inhibitors, in the Ex-PRC (worldwide except
PRC) territory, and (b) Merck KGaA, Darmstadt Germany granted us an exclusive license under
certain of its intellectual property rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize the Licensed
PARP Inhibitors in the People’s Republic of China, or the PRC, which we refer to as the PRC Territory.

On October 1, 2015, pursuant to a purchase of rights agreement, we repurchased all of Merck
KGaA, Darmstadt Germany’s rights under the Ex-PRC PARP Agreement, in consideration for, among
other things, a one-time payment of US$10 million, which payment has been made, and reduction of
future milestone payments we were eligible for under the PRC PARP Agreement. In connection with
that repurchase, we also agreed to provide Merck KGaA, Darmstadt Germany with global access to
our clinical PARP supplies, including pamiparib, for its combination trials, during the option period.
The Ex-PRC PARP Agreement was terminated, except for certain provisions that are needed to
effectuate the continuation of the PRC PARP Agreement, including those provisions that were required
in the event that Merck KGaA, Darmstadt Germany exercised its PRC Commercialization Option
(described below). We repurchased all of Merck KGaA, Darmstadt Germany’s rights under the
Ex-PRC PARP Agreement and terminated the Ex-PRC PARP Agreement in order to reacquire the rights
to pursue both monotherapy and combination therapy.

Pursuant to the PRC PARP Agreement, if we failed to achieve national priority project status in
the PRC Territory under its 12th or 13th five-year plan with respect to our pamiparib program in the
PRC Territory by July 28, 2017, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt Germany has an option to acquire exclusive
commercialization rights under the pamiparib program in the PRC Territory, which we refer to as the
PRC Commercialization Option. If, however, we achieved national priority by July 28, 2017, Merck
KGaA, Darmstadt Germany
exclusive
commercialization rights under the pamiparib program in the PRC Territory in the event we seek to
license our intellectual property rights to a third party. We applied for national priority project status
for pamiparib to be effective from the beginning of 2017, and our application is in process and we
believe that it will be approved. However, there have been unanticipated governmental delays that
have impacted the 2017 applicant pool for national project priority status and we expect that we will
now receive formal notification in 2018. As such, we intend to discuss with Merck KGaA, Darmstadt
Germany the impact of this delay on the PRC Commercialization Option. If Merck KGaA, Darmstadt
Germany exercises the PRC Commercialization Option, it is required to pay us a US$50 million
non-refundable payment upon such exercise, and we are eligible for a US$12.5 million milestone
payment upon the successful achievement of a certain additional regulatory event in the PRC Territory.
