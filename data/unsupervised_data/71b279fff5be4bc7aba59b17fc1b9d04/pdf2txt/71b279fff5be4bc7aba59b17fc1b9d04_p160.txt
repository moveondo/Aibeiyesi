INDUSTRY OVERVIEW

NRDL, and when they are so included, this influences the decision for NRDL inclusion. Provinces
tend to give priority to drugs that treat diseases with a high local prevalence and those that treat
catastrophic diseases at a reasonable price. Drugs that have been included in a PRDL can maintain the
reimbursement status until the subsequent update of such PRDL. Provinces and municipalities that
have recently updated their PRDLs include Xinjiang, Sichuan, Qinghai, Hebei, Guizhou, Gansu, Tibet,
Shanghai, Shandong, Jilin, Jiangxi, Jiangsu, Anhui, Heilongjiang, Hubei, Beijing, Henan and Ningxia.
