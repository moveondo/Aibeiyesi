ACCOUNTANTS’ REPORT

The Group applies ASC topic 820 (“ASC 820”), Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, in
measuring fair value. ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value
and requires disclosures to be provided on fair value measurement. ASC 820 establishes a three-tier
fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:

Level 1—Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or

liabilities in active markets.

Level 2—Include other inputs that are directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace.

Level 3—Unobservable inputs which are supported by little or no market activity.

information generated from market

ASC 820 describes three main approaches to measuring the fair value of assets and liabilities:
(1) market approach; (2) income approach and (3) cost approach. The market approach uses prices and
other relevant
transactions involving identical or comparable
assets or liabilities. The income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts to a
single present value amount. The measurement is based on the value indicated by current market
expectations about
that would
currently be required to replace an asset.

those future amounts. The cost approach is based on the amount
