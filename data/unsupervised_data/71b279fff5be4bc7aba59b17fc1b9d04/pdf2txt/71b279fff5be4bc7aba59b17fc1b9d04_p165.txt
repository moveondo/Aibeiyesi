Market Landscape of PD-1/PD-L1 Inhibitors in China

Currently available clinical data suggest that some of the most prevalent cancers in China, such
as lung, gastric, liver and esophageal cancers, are responsive to the PD-1 class of agents. In 2012,
38%, 45%, 51% and 49% of the worldwide mortalities from lung, gastric,
liver and esophageal
cancers, respectively, occurred in China, according to the World Health Organization. In addition,
China has a higher proportion of PD-1/PD-L1 responsive tumors in its total annual cancer incidence
in comparison to other geographies like the United States and the European Union. According to Chen
et al. 2016, the annual incidence of the top ten PD-1/PD-L1 responsive tumors in China is estimated
to be 3.0 million out of 4.3 million in total annual cancer incidence. In comparison, the estimated
annual incidence of the top ten PD-1/PD-L1 responsive tumors is 0.9 million out of 1.7 million in total
