STRUCTURE OF THE GLOBAL OFFERING

Specifically, prospective applicants for and investors in the Offer Shares should note that:

(a)

(b)

(c)

(d)

(e)

(f)

the Stabilizing Manager (or any person acting for it) may, in connection with the stabilizing
action, maintain a long position in the Shares;

there is no certainty as to the extent
Stabilizing Manager (or any person acting for it) will maintain such a long position;

to which and the time or period for which the

liquidation of any such long position by the Stabilizing Manager (or any person acting for
it) and selling in the open market may have an adverse impact on the market price of the
Shares;

no stabilizing action can be taken to support the price of the Shares for longer than the
stabilization period, which will begin on the Listing Date, and is expected to expire on
September 1, 2018, being the 30th day after the last day for lodging applications under the
Hong Kong Public Offering. After this date, when no further stabilizing action may be
taken, demand for the Shares, and therefore the price of the Shares, could fall;

the price of the Shares cannot be assured to stay at or above the Offer Price by the taking
of any stabilizing action; and

stabilizing bids or transactions effected in the course of the stabilizing action may be made
at any price at or below the Offer Price and can, therefore, be done at a price below the price
paid by applicants for, or investors in, the Offer Shares.

The Company will ensure or procure that an announcement in compliance with the Securities and
Futures (Price Stabilizing) Rules of the SFO will be made within seven days of the expiration of the
stabilization period.

Over-Allocation

Following any over-allocation of Shares in connection with the Global Offering, the Stabilizing
Manager (or any person acting for it) may cover such over-allocations by, among other methods,
exercising the Over-allotment Option in full or in part, by using Shares purchased by the Stabilizing
Manager (or any person acting for it) in the secondary market at prices that do not exceed the Offer
Price.

PRICING AND ALLOCATION

Pricing for the Offer Shares for the purpose of the various offerings under the Global Offering
will be fixed on the Price Determination Date, which is expected to be on or about Thursday, August
2, 2018 and, in any event, no later than Tuesday, August 7, 2018, by agreement between the Joint
Global Coordinators (on behalf of the Underwriters) and the Company, and the number of Offer Shares
to be allocated under the various offerings will be determined shortly thereafter.
