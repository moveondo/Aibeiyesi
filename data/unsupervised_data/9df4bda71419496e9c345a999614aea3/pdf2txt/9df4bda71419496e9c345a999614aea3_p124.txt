INDUSTRY OVERVIEW

Hard to Copy – Biologics are more difficult to replicate than traditional small-molecule
pharmaceuticals. Unlike traditional small-molecule pharmaceuticals, biologics usually have
large and complex molecular structures and specifics of the manufacturing process may
influence the molecular structure of the biologics produced. Even slight differences in the
structure can result in significant differences in safety efficacy profile.

Challenging Manufacturing – The living cells used to manufacture biologics are fragile
and sensitive to external environment. The characteristics of living cells impose high technical
requirements on the manufacturing process of biologics.

Heavy Capital Investment – Large-scale biologics manufacturing facilities may require
significantly more investment to build compared with similar-scale small-molecule facilities.

Stringent Regulation – Biologics regulations are still evolving. Currently the approval for
biologics generally involves a more complex registration process, including requirements for
more comprehensive clinical data.

significant development

Driven by a combination of increasing R&D investments, significant developments in
biotechnology and favorable policies, original biologics market is expected to continuously
grow in the near future. At the same time, the global market for biosimilars has also increased
rapidly driven by factors such as the expiry of patents protecting original biologics, increasing
demand for lower-priced drugs with similar efficacy, evolvement of regulatory systems and
improving R&D of biosimilar manufacturers.
