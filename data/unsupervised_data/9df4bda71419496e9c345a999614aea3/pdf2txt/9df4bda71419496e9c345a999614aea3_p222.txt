BLyS (BAFF, TNF ligand superfamily member 13B) primarily stimulates downstream
signaling through B cell surface receptors. There are three BLyS receptors on B cells, including
BR3 (BLyS receptor 3 or BAFF-R), TACI
(transmembrane activator-1 and calcium
modulatorand cyclophilin ligand-interactor) and BCMA (B cell maturation antigen). BLyS is
the sole ligand for BR3, whereas BLyS and its related molecule APRIL (a proliferation-
inducing ligand, TNF ligand superfamily member 13) can both interact with BCMA and TACI.
BR3 is essential for both survival and maturation of immature B cells, whereas TACI is critical
for T cell-independent responses of B cells to type I and type II antigens, negative regulation
of the B cell compartment and class-switch recombination of B cells. BCMA is expressed by
plasmablasts and plasma cells, and promotes plasma cell survival.

BR3 is specific for BLyS and signals through the alternative nuclear factor-␬B (NF-␬B)
pathway to enhance B-cell survival by upregulating anti-apoptotic proteins and through mTOR
and Pim2 to promote cell growth. Mice deficient in BLyS or BR3 have a profound decrease in
mature B2 cells. This is because the interaction of BLyS with BR3 is essential to the survival
of B cells past the early transitional (T1) stage.

In SLE, abnormal survival and selection or class switching of naïve autoreactive B cells
exist. It reported that elevated serum BLyS levels in some SLE patients may responsible for
aberrant autoreactive B cells. But it is important to further dissect the factors that determine
BLyS responsiveness of autoreactive B cells so as to find a means of determining which
individuals are most likely to be responsive to BLyS inhibition.

BLyS  can  bind  to  three  receptors 
(BCMA,  TACI, BR3) and APRIL can 
bind to two of these receptors (BCMA, 
TACI) but not to the third (BR3).
BLyS  is  the  sole  ligand  for  BR3  and 
BR3 is specific for BLyS.

BLyS cytokine is expressed and rapidly cleaved by myeloid cells and other immune cells. BLyS binds
to receptors on the surfaces of normal and autoreactive B cells, signaling them to survive, mature, and
differentiate into antibody-and autoantibody-producing cells.

BLyS Inhibitor can bind to soluble BLyS to prevent it from signaling through receptors on normal and
autoreactive B cells. A reduction in normal and autoreactive B cell signaling by BLyS results in more
of these cells going through apoptosis (programmed cell death).
