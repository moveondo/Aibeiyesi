We believe JS002 may be differentiated from the current lipid-lowering medications as its
mechanism of action is distinct from statins, which could benefit a large number of patients
with hypercholesterolemia.

Market Opportunity and Competition

Hypercholesterolemia has become a serious issue in China’s society as the number of
patients with hypercholesterolemia increased rapidly in recent years due to unhealthy diet and
life style and population ageing. The number of hypercholesterolemia patients in China
increased from 66.8 million in 2013 to 79.3 million in 2017, and is expected to further increase
to 95.9 million in 2022 and 110.5 million in 2030, according to the F&S Report. According to
the F&S Report, driven by a combination of factors including large addressable patient pool,
excellent clinical results and increased market penetration, global PCSK9 inhibitors market is
expected to grow rapidly in the following years to USD5.2 billion in 2022 and USD12.1 billion
in 2030, respectively.

The FDA has approved two anti-PCSK9 antibodies, namely evolocumab (sold under the
trade name Repatha by Amgen) and alirocumab (sold under the trade name Praluent by Sanofi).
These drugs have been a significant advance in the treatment of high blood cholesterol and had
aggregate worldwide sales of US$490 million in 2017. As of the Latest Practicable Date, there
was one PCSK9 inhibitor approved in China, namely evolocumab. Besides us, there were four
other anti-PCSK9 biologic drug candidates in clinical development in China, namely Praluent
(alirocumab) by Sanofi-Aventis, IBI306 by Innovent Biologics (Suzhou) Co. Ltd., AK-102 by
Akeso Biopharma Inc. and Dawnrays Biotechnology Capital (Asia) Limited and SHR-1209 by
Jiangsu Hengrui Medicine Co., Ltd. There was also one small molecule drug, namely
CVI-LM001 by CVI Pharmaceuticals, in Phase I clinical trial.
