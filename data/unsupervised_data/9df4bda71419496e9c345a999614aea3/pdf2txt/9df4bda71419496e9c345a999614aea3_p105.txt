WAIVERS FROM STRICT COMPLIANCE WITH THE LISTING RULES AND

EXEMPTIONS FROM STRICT COMPLIANCE WITH THE COMPANIES

(WINDING UP AND MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS) ORDINANCE

or “two years”, as the case may be. Our Company has complied with Rule 18A.06 of the
Listing Rules by the inclusion of the accountant’s report covering the two years ended
December 31, 2016 and 2017 and the six months ended June 30, 2018 in this prospectus. We
had not commercialized any drugs and therefore did not record any revenue from drug product
sales as of the Latest Practicable Date. Including audited financial information for the year
ended December 31, 2015 in this prospectus would require our Company and its reporting
accountant to undertake work beyond the requirements of Rule 18A.06 of the Listing Rules and
would be unduly burdensome. Our Company considers that the accountants’ report in Appendix
I, covering the Track Record Period, together with other disclosure in this prospectus, provide
potential investors with reasonably adequate and up-to-date information in the circumstances
to form a view on our track record, and all information that is necessary for potential investors
to make an informed assessment of the activities, assets and liabilities, financial position,
management and prospects of our Group has been included in this prospectus. As such, our
Company is of the view that any exemption with respect to Section 342(1) of the Companies
(Winding Up and Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance in relation to the above requirements
will not prejudice the interest of the investing public.

A certificate of exemption has been granted by the SFC under section 342A of the
Companies (Winding up and Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance in relation to paragraph 27
of Part I and paragraph 31 of Part II of the Third Schedule of the Companies (Winding Up and
Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance on the condition that the particulars of the exemption be
set forth in this prospectus and that this prospectus will be issued on or before December 11,
2018.

AND PRE-IPO OPTIONS

Rule 17.02(1)(b) of and paragraph 27 of Appendix 1A to the Listing Rules and paragraph

Provisions) Ordinance require our Company to disclose, among other things, details of the
number, description and amount of any Shares which any person has, or is entitled to be given,
an option to subscribe for, together with certain particulars of each option, namely the period
during which it is exercisable, the price to be paid for shares subscribed for under it, the
consideration (if any) given or to be given for it or for the right to it and the names and
addresses of the persons to whom it was given.

Our Company adopted the Share Incentive Scheme in May 2018. Our Company has
granted the Pre-IPO Options to the Grantees to subscribe for Shares pursuant to the respective
Share Incentive Agreements. As of the Latest Practicable Date, 5,798,000 Pre-IPO Options
were outstanding, entitling 255 Grantees to subscribe for an aggregate of 5,798,000 Domestic
Shares, representing approximately 0.96% of the total number of Domestic Shares in issue, and
