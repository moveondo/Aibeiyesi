Our Domestic Shares listed on NEEQ are not counted towards our public float for the

purpose of Rules 8.08 and 18A.07 of the Listing Rules.

We have applied for, and the Stock Exchange has granted, a waiver from strict compliance
with Rule 8.08(1) of the Listing Rules that the minimum public float be reduced and the
minimum percentage of the H Shares from time to time held by the public to be the highest of:
(a) 16%; (b) such percentage of H Shares to be held by the public immediately after completion
of the Global Offering (assuming the Overallotment Option is not exercised); or (c) such
percentage of H Shares to be held by the public after the exercise of the Over-allotment Option,
but the percentage of minimum public float so decided above shall be reduced as a result of
any increase in our Company’s issued share capital following any issue of Domestic Shares by
our Company upon exercise of any Pre-IPO Options and/or the 2018 Convertible Bonds,
provided that (i) the market capitalization of the portion of the total number of our Company’s
issued shares held by the public shall exceed HK$375 million at the time of Listing pursuant
to Rule 18A.07 of the Listing Rules and (ii) the minimum percentage of public float from time
to time shall not be lower than 15.71% of our Company’s issued share capital.

Please also refer to “Statutory and General Information – 2. Further Information about our

Business – C. Share Incentives” in Appendix V for details of the Pre-IPO Options.
