OUR HISTORY AND DEVELOPMENT

OUR HISTORY

Overview

We are an innovation-driven biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the discovery and
development of innovative drugs and their clinical research and commercialization on a global
scale.

Our Company was established on December 27, 2012 as a limited liability company with
a registered capital of RMB1 million, owned equally by Mr. Zhang Zhuobing, who is currently
an executive Director, and by Mr. Shan Jikuan, whose spouse was a founder of Shanghai Union
Biopharm. Mr. Shan and his spouse controlled Shanghai Union Biopharm from August 2010 to
November 2011. Mr. Shan transferred his Shares in 2013 and is no longer a Shareholder. In
January 2013, Mr. Xiong Jun and Mr. Xiong Fengxiang became our Shareholders holding an
aggregate of 37% equity interest in our Company at the relevant time immediately following
their acquisition of Shares.

In May 2015, our Company was converted into a joint-stock limited liability company and
renamed as “上海君實生物醫藥科技股份有限公司” (Shanghai Junshi Biosciences Co., Ltd.*).
Our Shares became listed on the NEEQ in August 2015. In June 2016, we completed our
merger with Shanghai Union Biopharm. Our registered capital was increased to RMB601.4
million as of the Latest Practicable Date after further rounds of investment.
