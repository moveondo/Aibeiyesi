EMPLOYEE’S SHARE INCENTIVES

In order to attract, retain and motivate our employees, and to align the interests of our
Company, our Shareholders, our management and our employees, we approved and adopted the
Share Incentive Scheme pursuant to resolution passed by the Shareholders on May 14, 2018
and we have also entered into the Share Incentive Agreements. A total of 268 Grantees have
been granted 6,023,000 Pre-IPO Options in aggregate, among which 13 Grantees had left our
Group and their 225,000 Pre-IPO Options had therefore lapsed. As of the Latest Practicable
Date, a total of 5,798,000 Pre-IPO Options granted remained outstanding. For further details,
please refer to the section headed “Statutory and General Information – 2. Further Information
about our Business – C. Share Incentives” in Appendix V to this prospectus.
