Features of UBP1213

UBP1213 has the following main features demonstrated in the preclinical studies:

(1) The dissociation rate of UBP1213 and BLyS is slow and the affinity is strong;

(2) UBP1213 has a strong ability to inhibit the binding of soluble BLyS and BR3-Fc;

(3)

In single dose toxicity study with 40 times the Minimal Anticipated Biological
Effect Level (MABEL) dosage and repeated dose toxicity study with 10 times the
MABEL dosage on cynomolgus monkeys, the findings in the studies were reversible
and could be related to the pharmacological effect of the test article, reflecting high
safety profile of UBP1213;

(4) Typical pharmacokinetic behavior of monoclonal antibodies was demonstrated in
the pharmacokinetic studies on cynomolgus monkeys adopting single doses of low,
medium and high doses and multiple doses of medium dose.

Based on the above features of UBP1213, we are advancing UBP1213 to the clinical trials

stage for the treatment of adult patients with SLE.

Cooperation with WHKB

Shanghai Union Biopharm entered into an agreement (the “WHKB Agreement”) in May
2012 with Wuhan Huaxin Kangyuan Biopharma Co., Ltd. (“WHKB”). Pursuant to the WHKB
Agreement:

(cid:129)

WHKB would transfer the IP relating to UBP1213 to us and assist us in the
development and commercialization of UBP1213 such as through the provision of
consultancy regarding the relevant clinical strategy and commercialization strategy
should we consider it necessary.

WHKB has a preemptive right if we choose to transfer UBP1213 to any third party
and is entitled to between 45% and 25% of the proceeds from a transfer to third party
based on the progress of pre-clinical research, clinical trials and NDA approval at
the time of the transfer.

Based on the progress of the development of UBP1213, we agreed to pay WHKB a
total of RMB13 million, the last instalment of which being RMB8 million upon the
completion of clinical trials.

Further, after the launch of UBP1213, WHKB is entitled to 35% of the profit from
the production and sales of UBP1213.
