Regulatory Progress and Next Steps

We are the first and only company in the PRC to obtain IND approval for recombinant
humanized anti-BLyS monoclonal antibody injection. We are planning for clinical trials of
UBP1213 and plan to commence patient enrolment for Phase I clinical trial of UBP1213 in
2019.

Other Clinical-stage Drug Candidates

JS003 (anti-PD-L1 mAb)

JS003 is a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting PD-L1 protein. PD-L1 has emerged
as an important cancer biomarker and a target for immunotherapy. The targeted blockade of
PD-L1 may help to restore the antitumor response. PD-L1 is frequently expressed on tumor
cells and tumor-infiltrating immune cells within the tumor microenvironment. The binding of
PD-L1 to PD-1 induces T-cell exhaustion, a state of ineffective T-cell activity. Proven by a
number of clinical researches,
the blockade of PD-L1 binding to PD-1 reverses T-cell
exhaustion and strengthens antitumor activity, which has become one of the promising
strategies in immuno-oncology. A number of international pharmaceutical companies have
developed antibody drugs targeting PD-L1, among which three PD-L1 inhibitor drugs have
been marketed and shown significant efficacy.

Preclinical studies have demonstrated that JS003, which binds to PD-L1 with high
affinity, is effective in blocking the interaction between PD-L1 and PD-1 and thereby activate
the T cell’s antitumor activity. As of the Latest Practicable Date, we had received IND approval
from the NMPA and were preparing for the clinical trial of JS003.
