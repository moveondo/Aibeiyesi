APPENDIX I

(b)

Diluted

ACCOUNTANTS’ REPORT

The Group issued the convertible loan notes during the six months ended June 30, 2018 as set out in Note 27.
For the purpose of calculation of diluted loss per share, it did not assume the conversion of the convertible loan notes
since their assumed conversion would result in a decrease in loss per share. The Group granted share options on May
14, 2018 as set out in Note 36. The computation of diluted loss per share for the six months ended June 30, 2018
does not assume the exercise of the Company’s outstanding share options since their assumed exercise would result
in a decrease in loss per share.

The Company does not have any dilutive potential ordinary shares outstanding during the years ended
December 31, 2016 and 2017 and thus no diluted loss per share for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2017
are presented.
