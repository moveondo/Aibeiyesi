The Group and the Company have entered into foreign currency forward contracts during the
Track Record Period which also expose the Group and the Company to foreign currency risk. The
foreign-currency forward contracts with notional amount are set out in Note 23.

Sensitivity analysis

The following table details the Group’s sensitivity to a 5% increase and decrease in RMB against
USD and the Company’s sensitivity to a 5% increase and decrease in RMB against USD. 5% is the
sensitivity rate used which represents management’s assessment of the reasonably possible change in
foreign exchange rates. The sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated
monetary items and foreign currency forward contracts and adjusts their translation, for a change in
foreign currency rates of 5% for each of the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2017 and six months
ended June 30, 2018. A positive/negative number below indicates an increase/decrease in loss where
RMB5% strengthens against USD by 5%. For a 5% weakening of RMB against USD, there would be
an equal and opposite impact on loss for the year/period.

In the opinion of the directors of the Company, the sensitivity analysis is unrepresentative of the
inherent foreign exchange risk as the year/period end exposure does not reflect the exposure during the
year/period.
