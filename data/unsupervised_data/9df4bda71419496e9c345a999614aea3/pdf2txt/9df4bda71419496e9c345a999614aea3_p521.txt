APPENDIX III

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL LEGAL AND
REGULATORY PROVISIONS

Under the Companies Ordinance, rights attached to any class of shares can only be varied
(i) in accordance with provisions of the articles of association for the variation of those rights,
or (ii) if there are no such provisions, with the consent of holders of shares in that class. For
this purpose, the consent required is (i) a special resolution of the holders of the relevant class
at a separate general meeting sanctioning the variation, or (ii) the written consent of
shareholders representing at least 75% of the total voting rights of shareholders of the relevant
class.

As required by the Listing Rules and the Mandatory Provisions, we have adopted in the
Articles of Association provisions protecting class rights in a similar manner to those found in
Hong Kong law. Holders of overseas listed shares and domestic listed shares are defined in the
Articles of Association as different classes. The special procedures for voting by a class of
Shareholders shall not apply in the following circumstances: (1) where we issue, upon approval
by a special resolution of our Shareholders in a general meeting, either separately or
concurrently every twelve months, not more than 20% of each of the existing issued H Shares
and Domestic Shares; (2) where our plan to issue H Shares and Domestic Shares on
establishment is implemented within fifteen months from the date of approval by the securities
regulatory authorities under the State Council; (3) upon approval by the securities regulatory
authorities under the State Council, the holders of Domestic Shares transfer their Shares to
overseas investors and list or trade their Shares on an overseas securities exchange; or (4) all
or part of the Domestic Shares are converted into overseas listed foreign shares and listed or
traded on an overseas securities exchange upon approval by the securities regulatory
authorities under the State Council.

Derivative actions by minority shareholders

Hong Kong law permits minority shareholders to commence a derivative action on behalf
of the company against directors who have committed a breach of their fiduciary duties to the
company if the directors control a majority of votes at a general meeting, thereby effectively
preventing the company from suing the directors in breach of their duties in its own name.

The PRC Company Law gives our Shareholders the rights to initiate proceedings in the
people’s courts in the PRC to restrain the implementation of any resolution passed by our
Shareholders in a general meeting, or by the meeting convening procedures or ways of voting
of the meetings of our Board of Directors, that violates any law, administrative rules or Articles
of Association or company’s articles of association, or if our Directors or senior management
violate laws, administrative rules or Articles of Association when performing their duties and
cause losses to our Company. The Mandatory Provisions also provide us with certain remedies
against our Directors and senior management who breach their duties to us. In addition, as a
condition to the listing of our H Shares on the Stock Exchange and in accordance with our
Articles of Association, each of our Directors is required to give an undertaking in favor of us
acting as agent for each of our Shareholders. This allows minority Shareholders to act against
our Directors in events of default.
