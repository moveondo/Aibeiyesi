EXEMPTION FROM STRICT COMPLIANCE WITH SECTION 342(1) IN RELATION

SCHEDULE TO THE COMPANIES (WINDING UP AND MISCELLANEOUS
PROVISIONS) ORDINANCE

Section 342(1)(b) of

the Companies (Winding Up and Miscellaneous Provisions)
Ordinance provides that all prospectuses are required to include the matters specified in Part
I of the Third Schedule thereto and the reports specified in Part II of the Third Schedule
thereto. According to paragraph 27 of Part I of the Third Schedule to the Companies (Winding
Up and Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance, our Company is required to include in this
prospectus a statement as to the gross trading income or sales turnover (as may be appropriate)
of our Company during each of the three financial years immediately preceding the issue of this
prospectus, including an explanation of the method used for the computation of such income
or turnover, and a reasonable breakdown between the more important
trading activities.
According to paragraph 31 of Part II of the Third Schedule to the Companies (Winding Up and
Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance, our Company is required to include in this prospectus a
report by our auditor with respect to profits and losses and assets and liabilities of our
Company in respect of each of the three financial years immediately preceding the issue of this
prospectus.

Pursuant

to Section 342A(1) of

the Companies (Winding Up and Miscellaneous
Provisions) Ordinance, the SFC may issue, subject to such conditions (if any) as the SFC thinks
fit, a certificate of exemption from compliance with any or all of the requirements of the
relevant provisions under
the Companies (Winding Up and Miscellaneous Provisions)
Ordinance if, having regard to the circumstances, the SFC considers that the exemption will not
prejudice the interest of the investing public and compliance with any or all of such
requirements would be irrelevant or unduly burdensome, or is otherwise unnecessary or
inappropriate.

An application has been made to the SFC for a certificate of exemption from strict
compliance with the requirements under section 342(1) in relation to paragraph 27 of Part I and
paragraph 31 of Part II of the Third Schedule to the Companies (Winding up and Miscellaneous
Provisions) Ordinance on the ground that our Company is a biotech company (as defined in the
Listing Rules) and is subject to the requirements under Chapter 18A of the Listing Rules.
According to Rule 18A.06 of the Listing Rules, a biotech company (as defined in the Listing
Rules) must comply with Rule 4.04 of the Listing Rules modified so that references to “three
financial years” or “three years” in that Rule shall instead reference to “two financial years”
