APPENDIX I

IFRS 16 Leases

ACCOUNTANTS’ REPORT

IFRS 16 introduces a comprehensive model for the identification of lease arrangements and accounting
treatments for both lessors and lessees. IFRS 16 will supersede IAS 17 Leases and the related interpretations when
it becomes effective.

IFRS 16 distinguishes lease and service contracts on the basis of whether an identified asset is controlled by
a customer. Distinctions of operating leases and finance leases are removed for lessee accounting, and is replaced by
a model where a right-of-use asset and a corresponding liability have to be recognised for all leases by lessees, except
for short-term leases and leases of low value assets.

The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost and subsequently measured at cost (subject to certain
exceptions) less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, adjusted for any re-measurement of the lease
liability. The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at that
date. Subsequently, the lease liability is adjusted for interest and lease payments, as well as the impact of lease
modifications, amongst others. For the classification of cash flows, the Group currently presents upfront prepaid lease
payments as investing cash flows in relation to leasehold lands for owned use while other operating lease payments
are presented as operating cash flows. Upon application of the IFRS 16, lease payments in relation to lease liability
will be allocated into a principal and an interest portion which will be presented as financing cash flows respectively
by the Group.

Under IAS 17, the Group has already recognised prepaid lease payments for leasehold lands where the Group
is a lessee. The application of IFRS 16 may result in potential changes in classification of these assets depending on
whether the Group presents right-of-use assets separately or within the same line item at which the corresponding
underlying assets would be presented if they were owned.

In contrast to lessee accounting, IFRS 16 substantially carries forward the lessor accounting requirements in

IAS 17, and continues to require a lessor to classify a lease either as an operating lease or a finance lease.

Furthermore, extensive disclosures are required by IFRS 16.

At

June 30, 2018,

the Group has non-cancellable operating lease commitments of approximately
RMB14,031,000 as disclosed in Note 34. A preliminary assessment indicates that these arrangements will meet the
definition of a lease. Upon application of IFRS 16, the Group will recognise a right-of-use asset and a corresponding
liability in respect of all these leases unless they qualify for low value or short-term leases.

In addition, the Group currently considers refundable rental deposits paid of RMB6,228,000 as at June 30,
2018 as rights under leases to which IAS 17 applies. Based on the definition of lease payments under IFRS 16, such
deposits are not payments relating to the right to use the underlying assets, accordingly, the carrying amounts of such
deposits may be adjusted to amortised cost and such adjustments are considered as additional lease payments.
Adjustments to refundable rental deposits paid would be included in the carrying amount of right-of-use assets.

Furthermore, the application of new requirements may result changes in measurement, presentation and

disclosure as indicated above.

The directors of the Company assessed that such changes would increase the consolidated assets and
consolidated liabilities of the Group, but would not result in a significant impact on the financial performance of the
Group upon adoption of IFRS 16.
