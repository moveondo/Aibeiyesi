acquisition of its own or its holding company’s shares. However, the Mandatory Provisions
contain certain restrictions on a company and its subsidiaries on providing such financial
assistance similar to those under the Hong Kong law.

Mandatory deductions

Under the PRC Company Law, a joint stock limited liability company is required to make
transfers equivalent to certain prescribed percentages of its after tax profit to the statutory
common reserve fund. There are no corresponding provisions under Hong Kong law.
