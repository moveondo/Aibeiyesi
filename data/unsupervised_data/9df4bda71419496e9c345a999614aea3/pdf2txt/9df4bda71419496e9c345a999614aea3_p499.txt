APPENDIX II

UNAUDITED PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION

A reasonable assurance engagement

to report on whether the unaudited pro forma
financial
information has been properly compiled on the basis of the applicable criteria
involves performing procedures to assess whether the applicable criteria used by the Directors
in the compilation of the unaudited pro forma financial information provide a reasonable basis
for presenting the significant effects directly attributable to the event or transaction, and to
obtain sufficient appropriate evidence about whether:

(cid:129)

(cid:129)

the related pro forma adjustments give appropriate effect to those criteria; and

the unaudited pro forma financial information reflects the proper application of
those adjustments to the unadjusted financial information.

The procedures selected depend on the reporting accountants’ judgment, having regard to
the reporting accountants’ understanding of the nature of the Group, the event or transaction
in respect of which the unaudited pro forma financial information has been compiled, and other
relevant engagement circumstances.

The engagement also involves evaluating the overall presentation of the unaudited pro

forma financial information.

We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a

basis for our opinion.

information as disclosed pursuant to paragraph 4.29(1) of the Listing Rules.
