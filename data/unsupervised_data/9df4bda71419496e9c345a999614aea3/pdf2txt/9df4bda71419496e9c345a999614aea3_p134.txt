INDUSTRY OVERVIEW

Notes:

(1)

Key assumptions include (i) TNF-␣ inhibitors from the Company, Henlius and some other PRC
companies will be launched in 2019; (ii) the retail prices of biosimilars from local companies in China
will be 70% of Humira; (iii) In 2019, both Humira and its biosimilars will be added to the NRDL.
Humira annual treatment cost will decrease by 40% upon its addition to the NRDL and further decrease
by 2% in each subsequent year; (iv) Humira biosimilars will account for 93.0% of addressable patient
population in China when they reach the peak of sales with a 90.3% market share by sales revenue

(2)

The estimates have not taken into account off-label prescriptions.

Competitive landscape

There are five FDA approved TNF-␣ original biologics marketed in the United States,
while most of the ongoing clinical trials for TNF-␣ inhibitors are focused on biosimilars. As
of the Latest Practicable Date, there had been five Humira biosimilars under Phase III clinical
trials in the United States.

As of the Latest Practicable Date, there were two anti-TNF-␣ fully human or humanized
monoclonal antibodies, marketed in the PRC, namely Humira and Simponi, both of which were
developed by multinational companies. In addition, there were nine anti-TNF-␣ monoclonal
antibodies undergoing clinical trials in the PRC as shown in the table below.

There are different licensed patents for Humira (adalimumab) which may cover the
molecule, dosage form and indications. Among all the patents, the main molecule patent,
US6090382, which greatly determines the legal usage of Humira, expired in 2016 in the U.S.
The corresponding China patent, CN101302515, expired in 2017 in China. The main patent of
Simponi, CN1468308B and CN101980017B, will both expire in 2021 in China. With the patent
expiration of Humira and Simponi in China, Adalimumab and golimumab biosimilar can go to
the market legally. Adalimumab biosimilars are expected to launch in China in 2019.
