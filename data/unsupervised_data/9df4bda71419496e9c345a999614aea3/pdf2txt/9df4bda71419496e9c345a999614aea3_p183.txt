these clinical

trials had been completed as of

lung cancer, breast cancer, neuroendocrine tumor,

urothelial cancer, gastric cancer, esophageal cancer, nasopharyngeal cancer, non-
lymphoma and
small cell
sarcoma. Some of
the Latest
Practicable Date. In particular, we had completed the pivotal clinical
trial for
second-line metastatic melanoma for JS001, based on which we have filed NDA
with the NMPA in March 2018. Such NDA has completed CDE technical review on
December 1, 2018 and was under administrative review by the NMPA as of the
Latest Practicable Date. We expect to obtain such NDA approval in late 2018 or
early 2019 and are preparing to launch JS001 in the PRC shortly after obtaining
NDA approval.

JS001 has also received IND approval from FDA and is currently undergoing a
Phase I clinical trial in the United States. In addition, we plan to launch a global
large-scale pivotal clinical trial in the second half of 2019 aiming at obtaining
additional overseas regulatory approvals to launch JS001.

As of the Latest Practicable Date, JS001 was close to commercialization only for the
second-line treatment of metastatic melanoma in the PRC, while the majority of
JS001 clinical
trials for other indications were in Phase I or Phase II stages.
Melanoma represents only approximately 0.2% of the total new cases of cancer in
the PRC in 2017. By comparison, two competing PD-1 inhibitors from MNCs were
already marketed in the PRC as of the Latest Practicable Date, which covered more
indications that represent larger fractions of the total new cases of cancer in the PRC
than melanoma alone in 2017. Further, the PD-1/PD-L1 therapeutic area, which our
JS001 and JS003 belong to,
is an extremely fierce market. As of the Latest
Practicable Date, multiple PD-1 inhibitors from PRC companies were at various
stages of commercialization and there was no assurance that our JS001 would be the
first PD-1 inhibitor by a PRC company to commercialize in the PRC.

UBP1211 is a biosimilar of Humira (adalimumab) used for the treatment of
autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. UBP1211 is one of the first
Humira biosimilars developed by a PRC company to receive IND approval from the
NMPA. As of the Latest Practicable Date, we had completed patient enrollment for
Phase III clinical trial of UBP1211. We plan to file NDA with the NMPA in the
second half of 2019.

JS002 is the first anti-PCSK9 monoclonal antibody developed by a PRC company
to obtain IND approval from the NMPA. Pre-clinical experimental data have shown
that JS002 has excellent activity in reducing low-density lipoprotein. As of the
Latest Practicable Date, JS002 was under Phase I clinical trial. We plan to complete
Phase I clinical
for primary
hypercholesterolemia and mixed dyslipidemia in December 2018.
