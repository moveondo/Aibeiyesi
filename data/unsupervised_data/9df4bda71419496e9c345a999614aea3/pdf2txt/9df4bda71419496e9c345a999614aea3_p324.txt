Net cash used in operating activities

During the Track Record Period, we derived our cash inflow from operating activities
mainly from income generated from consulting and research agreements as well as sales of
reagents. Our cash outflow from operating activities mainly consists of
research and
development expenses and administrative expenses.

For the six months ended June 30, 2018, we had net cash used in operating activities of
approximately RMB263.6 million, primarily due to operating loss before movements in
working capital of approximately RMB249.4 million and the negative effect of the movements
in working capital. The negative movements in working capital mainly include: (i) an increase
in trade and other receivables of approximately RMB55.6 million due to the increased
prepayments consisting of upfront fee paid for research and development services for the
clinical and non-clinical study of our drug candidates;
increased value added tax
recoverable; and (iii) an increase in inventories of approximately RMB17.4 million due to the
increased purchase of raw materials and consumables. These cash outflow were partially offset
by (i) an increase in trade and other payables of approximately RMB53.6 million due to
increased trade payables to third parties and accrued expenses mainly driven by the payables
to contract research organisations for drugs advancing to late clinical stage, particularly in
relation to JS001, and the increase in payables for listing expenses; and (ii) an increase in
deferred income of approximately RMB5.3 million, due to increased government grants.
