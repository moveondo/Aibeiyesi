Investment policies and risk management measures

During the Track Record Period, we managed our surplus cash mainly through investing
in short-term financial products that we believe have relatively low risks and offer better
returns than cash deposits at licensed commercial banks in the PRC. Accordingly, we generally
adopt
investment measures that govern our investments in such financial assets. These
measures include, among other things, the following:

(cid:129)

(cid:129)

(cid:129)

Investments in available-for-sale investments shall be made when we have surplus
cash that is not required for our short-term working capital purposes;

The types of investments shall be generally low-to medium-risk wealth management
products issued by licensed financial institutions in the PRC;

Our members of senior management, including our Chairman, shall consider the
criteria of the investments, which include, but are not limited to, cash liquidity, time
value of currencies, investment risks involved and expected return.

To better detect and manage the risks we are exposed to in our operations, we have
implemented a comprehensive set of risk management measures, which are set forth below:

(cid:129)

Different departments of our Company shall be separately responsible for the
management, execution and supervision of our Company’s surplus cash investment
and capital management;

Designated personnel would monitor the progress and stability of the investment
products purchased and our Chairman will be provided with a regular update
regarding the details of the investments;

Once the risks are properly identified and analyzed, appropriate risk management
measures shall be implemented, which include avoiding risks, mitigating risks and
securing the safety of the principals.

Pledged Bank Deposits and Bank Balances and Cash

Our pledged bank deposits were pledged to banks for securing forward contracts with
interest rate of 1.10% to 1.75%. Our bank balances and cash comprised cash and short term
bank deposits with an original maturity of three months or less. Bank balances carried interest
at market rates which ranged from 0.10% to 1.00% per annum as at December 31, 2016, from
0.10% to 1.00% per annum as at December 31, 2017, and 0.30% to 1.00% per annum as at June
30, 2018.
