APPENDIX I

ACCOUNTANTS’ REPORT

Note a: A slight increase in the expected volatility used in isolation would result in a slight increase in the
fair value measurement of convertible loan notes, and vice versa. If the volatility was 5%
higher/lower to 47%/37% while holding all other variables constant, the carrying amount of the
convertible loan notes would increase by RMB7,377,000 or decrease by RMB3,969,000 as at June
30, 2018.

Note b: A slight increase in the discount rate used in isolation would result in a slight decrease in the fair
value measurement of convertible loan notes, and vice versa. If the discount rate was 0.5%
higher/lower to 20.5%/19.5% while all other variables constant,
the carrying amount of the
convertible loan notes would decrease by RMB1,715,000 or increase by RMB4,795,000 as at June
30, 2018.

Fair value gains or

losses on convertible loan notes designated at FVTPL of approximately
RMB1,881,000 are included in ‘other gains and losses’ with the remaining amount of approximately
RMB7,720,000 capitalised in construction-in-progress.

(iii) Fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities that are not measured at fair value on a

recurring basis

The fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities is determined in accordance with generally

accepted pricing models based on discounted cash flow analysis.

The directors of the Company consider that the carrying amounts of financial assets and financial
liabilities of the Group recorded at amortised cost in the Historical Financial Information approximate to their
fair value based on the discounted cash flows analysis.
