ACQUISITION OF A SUBSIDIARY

On August 29, 2016, Beijing Junke Jingde Biotechnology Co., Ltd, being a non-wholly owned subsidiary of
the Company, acquired the entire equity interest in Xinjingke, which is mainly engaged in the business of sales of
biological reagent, for a total consideration of RMB1,000,000. Xinjingke was acquired so as to expand the Group into
a new line of business. This acquisition has been accounted for using the acquisition method. The amount of goodwill
arising as a result of the acquisition was RMB1,519,000. No significant acquisition-related costs are recognised for
the year ended December 31, 2016.

Goodwill arose in the acquisition of Xinjingke because the cost paid for the benefit of expected revenue growth
and future relevant development to be contributed to the Group. These benefits are not recognised separately from
goodwill because they do not meet the recognition criteria for identifiable intangible assets. None of the goodwill
arising on these acquisitions is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.

Included in the loss for the year from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 is
RMB477,000 attributable to the additional loss generated by Xinjingke. Revenue from discontinued operations for
the year ended December 31, 2016 includes RMB2,183,000 revenue generated from Xinjingke.

Had the acquisition been completed on January 1, 2016, the Group’s revenue for the year ended December 31,
2016 would have been RMB9,313,000 from both continuing and discontinued operations, and the Group’s loss for
the year ended December 31, 2016 would have been RMB132,750,000 from both continuing and discontinued
operations. The pro forma information is for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily an indication of revenue
and results of operations of the Group that actually would have been achieved had the acquisition been completed
on January 1, 2016, nor is it intended to be a projection of future results.
