STRUCTURE OF THE GLOBAL OFFERING

If, for any reason, our Company and the Lead Global Coordinator (for itself and on behalf
of the Underwriters) are unable to reach agreement on the Offer Price on or before Friday,
December 21, 2018, the Global Offering will not proceed and will lapse.

Reduction in Indicative Offer Price Range and/or Number of Offer Shares

The Lead Global Coordinator, on behalf of the Underwriters, may, where considered
appropriate, based on the level of
interest expressed by prospective professional and
institutional investors during the book-building process, and with the consent of our Company,
reduce the number of Offer Shares and/or the indicative Offer Price range as stated in this
prospectus at any time on or prior to the morning of the last day for lodging applications under
the Hong Kong Public Offering. In such case, we will, as soon as practicable following the
decision to make such reduction, and in any event not later than the morning of the day which
is the last day for lodging applications under the Hong Kong Public Offering, cause to be
published in the South China Morning Post (in English) and the Hong Kong Economic Times
(in Chinese) and on the website of the Stock Exchange at www.hkexnews.hk and the Company
at www.junshipharma.com, notices of the reduction. Upon issue of such a notice, the revised
number of Offer Shares and/or indicative Offer Price range will be final and conclusive and the
Offer Price, if agreed upon by the Lead Global Coordinator, for itself and on behalf of the
Underwriters, and our Company, will be fixed within such a revised Offer Price range. Such
notice will also include confirmation or revision, as appropriate, of the working capital
statement and the Global Offering statistics as currently set out in the prospectus, use of
proceeds, and any other financial information which may change materially as a result of such
reduction. As soon as practicable of such reduction of the number of Offer Shares and/or the
indicative Offer Price range, we will also issue a supplemental prospectus updating investors
of such reduction together with an update of all financial and other information in connection
with such change, where appropriate, extend the period under which the Hong Kong Public
Offering was open for acceptance, and give potential investors who had applied for the Offer
Shares the right to withdraw their applications. If the number of Offer Shares and/or the
indicative Offer Price range is so reduced, applicant(s) who have already submitted an
application may or may not (depending on the information in the announcement) be notified
that they are required to confirm their applications. All applicants who have already submitted
an application need to confirm their applications in accordance with the procedures set out in
the announcement and all unconfirmed applications will not be valid. In the absence of any
such notice so published, the number of Offer Shares will not be reduced and the Offer Price,
if agreed upon by the Lead Global Coordinator, for itself and on behalf of the Underwriters,
and our Company, will under no circumstances be set outside the Offer Price range as stated
in this prospectus.

Before submitting applications for the Hong Kong Offer Shares, applicants should have
regard to the possibility that any announcement of a reduction in the number of Offer Shares
and/or the indicative Offer Price range may not be made until the day which is the last day for
lodging applications under the Hong Kong Public Offering.
