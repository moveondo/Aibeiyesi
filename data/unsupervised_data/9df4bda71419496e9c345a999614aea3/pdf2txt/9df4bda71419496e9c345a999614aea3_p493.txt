SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

In September, 2018, the Company together with other four independent third parties established a company in
the PRC, Beijing Zhenzhi Medical Technology Co., Ltd. (北京臻知醫學科技有限責任公司) (“Zhenzhi”), a limited
liability company principally engaged in technology services and medical research and development. The total capital
commitment by the Company is RMB3.0 million, representing 15% equity interests of Zhenzhi. In November, 2018,
the Company paid capital of RMB3.0 million to Zhenzhi.

In October 2018, the Group entered into a 4 year loan facility up to RMB150.0 million with the Bank of
Shanghai and drew down RMB80.0 million under the facility. The loan facility bears a variable interest rate by
floating upwards by 40% based on the relevant 1 to 5 years benchmark interest rate published by the People’s Bank
of China per annum. The loan facility will mature in November 2022 and guaranteed by the Company and its
subsidiary Suzhou Union Biopharm Biosciences Co., Ltd. Pursuant to the agreement, the bank borrowing is also
secured by mortgages over the Group’s property, plant and equipment situated in Shanghai Lingang and Wujiang
Economic and Industrial Development Zone held by its subsidiaries, Shanghai Junshi Biotechnology Co., Ltd. and
Suzhou Union Biopharm Biosciences Co., Ltd.
