APPENDIX IA

CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

For continuing operation, the Group has been operating in one reporting segment, being the discovery,

development and commercialisation of drugs.

On April 25, 2018, the Group has entered into a contract to sell the equity interest in the subsidiary engaged
in the sales of biologic reagent. The disposal was completed on June 29, 2018 and details of which are set out in Note
7 and accordingly such operating segment has been presented as discontinued operation.

For the purpose of resources allocation and performance assessment, the Group’s chief executive officer, being
the chief operating decision maker, reviews the consolidated results when making decisions about allocating
resources and assessing performance of the Group as a whole and hence, the Group has only one reportable segment
and no further analysis of this single segment is presented.
