EXEMPTIONS FROM STRICT COMPLIANCE WITH THE COMPANIES

(WINDING UP AND MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS) ORDINANCE

Upon Listing, RMB200 million of the 2018 Convertible Bonds, convertible into a
maximum of 8,613,274 Domestic Shares (assuming the Over-allotment Option is not exercised
and based on the low-end of the Offer Price), representing approximately 1.12% of the issued
share capital of our Company upon full conversion (for illustration purpose only and before
exercise of the Over-allotment Option) are outstanding.

For illustration purpose only, assuming the Over-allotment Option is not exercised and
based on the low-end of the Offer Price, the public float of our Company is expected to be (i)
not below 15.83% assuming 8,613,274 Domestic Shares to be issued upon full conversion of
the 2018 Convertible Bonds, and (ii) not below 15.71% assuming 8,613,274 Domestic Shares
to be issued upon full conversion of the 2018 Convertible Bonds, and 5,798,000 Domestic
Shares to be issued upon full exercise of the Pre-IPO Options.

Conversion of the 2018 Convertible Bonds is also subject

to terms and conversion
restrictions, among others, if the number of our Shareholders exceeds 200, the holder(s) of the
2018 Convertible Bonds may not submit any conversion application. For further details of the
2018 Convertible Bonds, including number of Domestic Shares that may be issued and its
conversion restriction, see “Our History and Development – Issuance of the 2018 Convertible
Bonds”.

Based on the minimum Offer Price of HK$19.38 and assuming no exercise of the
Over-allotment Option and without regard to the 2018 Convertible Bonds and the Pre-IPO
Options, we expect our market capitalization will be over HK$10 billion.

In support of such application, we have confirmed to the Stock Exchange that we will:

(a) make appropriate disclosure of the lower prescribed percentage of public float in

this prospectus in accordance with Rule 8.08(1)(d) of the Listing Rules;

(b)

(c)

(d)

as soon as practicable announce the percentage of H Shares held by the public
immediately after completion of the Global Offering (but before the exercise of the
Over-allotment Option), such that the public will be informed of the minimum
public float requirement applicable to us;

confirm sufficiency of public float in our successive annual reports after the Listing
in accordance with Rule 8.08(1)(d) of the Listing Rules;

implement appropriate measures and mechanisms to ensure continual maintenance
of the minimum percentage of public float prescribed by the Stock Exchange;

(e)

continue to comply with Rules 8.08(2) and 8.08(3) of the Listing Rules;
