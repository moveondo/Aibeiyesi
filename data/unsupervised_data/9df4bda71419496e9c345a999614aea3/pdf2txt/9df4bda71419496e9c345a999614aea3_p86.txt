liabilities, and subject us to other risks.

We may evaluate various acquisitions and strategic partnerships, including licensing or
technology or businesses. Any potential

increased operating expenses and cash requirements;

assumption of additional indebtedness or contingent liabilities;

initiatives in pursuing such a strategic merger or acquisition;

retention of key employees, loss of key personnel, and uncertainties in our ability to
maintain key business relationships;

risks and uncertainties associated with the other party to such a transaction,

associated acquisition and maintenance costs.
