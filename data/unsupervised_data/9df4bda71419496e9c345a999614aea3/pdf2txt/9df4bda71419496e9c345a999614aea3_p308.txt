FINANCIAL INFORMATION

Our net gains from fair value changes of other financial assets measured at FVTPL
decreased from approximately RMB10.2 million in 2016 to approximately RMB6.2 million in
2017. This was mainly driven by the loss from contracts we entered into in respect of financial
products with financial institutions and decrease in fair value of the contracts of funds we
entered into with financial institutions. Our net gains from fair value changes of other financial
assets measured at FVTPL increased from approximately RMB0.4 million for the six months
ended June 30, 2017 to approximately RMB3.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018,
primarily due to the gain of our financial products. For details of the financial products we
procured, see “– Current Assets and Liabilities – Other Financial Assets”.

We recorded gain on fair value changes of foreign exchange forward contracts of
approximately RMB4.6 million in 2016 and recorded loss on fair value changes of foreign
exchange forward contracts of approximately RMB31.1 million and RMB6.4 million in 2017
and for the six months ended June 30, 2018, respectively. The fluctuation in gain and loss is
mainly due to the rising or declining trend, as the case may be, of the U.S. dollar exchange rate
against the Renminbi in the relevant year or period.

We issued convertible loan notes in February 2018 and recorded approximately RMB9.6
million as loss on fair value changes of the convertible loan notes measured at FVTPL for the
six months ended June 30, 2018, primarily due to changes to key inputs used in assessing the
fair value of convertible loan notes. For further details, please refer to Note 27 of the
Accountants’ Report in Appendix I to this prospectus.
