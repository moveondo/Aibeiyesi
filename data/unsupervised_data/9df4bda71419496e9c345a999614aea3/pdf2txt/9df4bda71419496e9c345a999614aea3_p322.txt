FINANCIAL INFORMATION

Our trade and other payables increased significantly from approximately RMB18.4
million as at December 31, 2016 to approximately RMB41.5 million as at December 31, 2017,
mainly due to our increased payables to raw material suppliers and clinical and non-clinical
research service providers, which were in line with the development progress of our drug
candidates, as well as to construction service providers and equipment suppliers, which were
in line with the construction progress of our manufacturing bases. The increase was also
attributable to the increase in salary and bonus payables as a result of an increased number of
employees from 201 as at December 31, 2016 to 311 as at December 31, 2017. As at June 30,
2018, our trade and other payables further increased to approximately RMB108.5 million,
primarily because of the increase in payables to raw material suppliers and clinical and
non-clinical research service providers, as well as the increase in notes payables.

As at November 30, 2018, 40.7% of our trade and other payables as at June 30, 2018 had

been settled.

Contract Liabilities

Our contract liabilities comprise amounts received in advance of delivery for biological
reagents. Our contract liabilities remained relatively stable at approximately RMB0.6 million
as at December 31, 2016 and 2017. We did not incur contract liabilities as at June 30, 2018.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Our use of cash primarily relates to our research and development activities, purchase of
raw materials and consumables,
investments in property, plant and equipment and other
recurring expenses. During the Track Record Period, we financed our working capital
requirements principally through a combination of debt and equity securities offerings,
consulting and research services, collaboration agreements, capital contribution from our
Shareholders and government grants. As at December 31, 2016 and 2017, June 30 and
November 30, 2018, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately RMB111.4 million,
RMB266.3 million, RMB391.9 million and RMB180.4 million, respectively.

The directors of the Company are of the opinion that, taking into consideration the cash
flows from the operations, financial resources available to the Group including existing
facilities and cash and cash equivalents on hand, and the expected net proceeds from the
proposed listing of shares of the Company on the Main Board of The Stock Exchange of Hong
Kong Limited, the Group has available sufficient working capital to cover at least 125% of the
Group’s cost,
including general administrative, operating costs as well as research and
development costs for at least 12 months from the date of this prospectus.
