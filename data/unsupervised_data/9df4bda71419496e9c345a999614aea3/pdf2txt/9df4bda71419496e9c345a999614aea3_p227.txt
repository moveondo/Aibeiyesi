pharmaceutical drug candidates. We have a leading edge in the emerging field of immuno-
oncology and for treatment of autoimmune and metabolic diseases in the PRC. Our innovative
field is expected to expand to include more types of drug discovery, including small molecule
drugs and antibody drug conjugates, as well as the exploration of the next-generation
innovative therapies for cancer and autoimmune diseases.

Our integrated R&D capabilities are proven by a track record of success. We have a robust
pipeline of 13 drug candidates, 11 of which, namely JS001 to JS011, are innovative drugs
developed by ourselves while the remaining two, namely UBP1211 and UBP1213, were jointly
developed by us and third parties. We believe our research platform for immuno-oncology and
a molecular screening platform for drug molecule are internationally advanced, and we have
two innovative drugs in the research product pipeline which have the potential to be global
first-in-class drugs. More target exploration and verification work is currently carried out. With
the continued process of the research work, more drug candidates will enter into our future
development pipeline to provide innovative impetus

development.

for

We have built a strong R&D team. As at June 30, 2018, we had assembled a team of 111
R&D personnel in the PRC and the United States. 49 of our R&D staff have master’s degrees
or above. Our key technical staff have deep expertise in the biopharmaceutical industry, many
of them with experience working in biotechnology research fields including in U.S. research
institutions and MNCs.
