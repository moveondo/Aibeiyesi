All of the products are not included in the NRDL or PRDL.

Direct competitors for UBP1211 are fully human anti-TNF␣ mAb and humanized anti-TNF␣ mAb pipeline
products in China.

Regulatory Progress and Next Steps

UBP1211 was approved by the NMPA to conduct clinical trials in May 2016, being one
of the first Humira biosimilars developed by PRC companies to receive IND approval from the
NMPA. As of the Latest Practicable Date, we had completed patient enrollment for Phase III
clinical trial of UBP1211 totalling 524 patients. We expect to complete Phase I clinical trial in
the first quarter of 2019 and Phase III clinical trial in the second quarter of 2019 for UBP1211.
We plan to file NDA with the NMPA in the second half of 2019.

JS002 (anti-PCSK9 mAb)

JS002 is a recombinant humanized anti-PCSK9 monoclonal antibody for injection, which
is designed for the treatment of certain cardiovascular diseases. We currently are cooperating
with Fuwai Hospital, a top clinical trial center in the PRC, and are close to conclude the Phase
I clinical trial to evaluate the safety and tolerability of JS002 in volunteer patients.
