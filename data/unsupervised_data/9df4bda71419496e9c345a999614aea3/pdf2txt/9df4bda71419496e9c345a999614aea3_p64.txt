RISK FACTORS

may require a substantial amount of education and training. This may have a material impact
on our ability to generate revenue from our drug candidates, which in turn may adversely affect
our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We may fail to complete the regulatory approval processes for our drug candidates, which
are lengthy, time consuming and inherently unpredictable.

The time required to obtain approval by the FDA, the NMPA, the EMA, and other
comparable regulatory authorities is unpredictable but typically takes many years following the
commencement of preclinical studies and clinical trials and depends on numerous factors,
including the substantial discretion of the regulatory authorities.

Our drug candidates could fail

to receive regulatory approval

failure to begin or complete clinical trials due to disagreements with regulatory
authorities;

failure to demonstrate that a drug candidate is safe and effective or that a biologic
candidate is safe, pure, and potent for its proposed indication;

failure of clinical trial results to meet the level of statistical significance required for
approval;

data integrity issues related to our clinical trials;

disagreement with our interpretation of data from preclinical studies or clinical
trials;

changes in approval policies or regulations that render our preclinical and clinical
data insufficient for approval or require us to amend our clinical trial protocols;

regulatory requests for additional analyses, reports, data, nonclinical studies and
clinical trials, or questions regarding interpretations of data and results and the
emergence of new information regarding our drug candidates or other products;

our failure to conduct a clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or
our clinical trial protocols; and

clinical sites, investigators or other participants in our clinical trials deviating from
a trial protocol,
in accordance with regulatory
requirements, or dropping out of a trial.
