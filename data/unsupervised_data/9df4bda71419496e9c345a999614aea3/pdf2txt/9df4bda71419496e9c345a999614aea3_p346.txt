FUTURE PLANS AND USE OF PROCEEDS

(cid:129)

Approximately 10% of the net proceeds, or HK$302.11 million, will be used for our
working capital and other general corporate purposes.

The above allocation of the proceeds will be adjusted on a pro rata basis in the event that
the Offer Price is fixed below or above the midpoint of the indicative price range. Any
additional proceeds received from the exercise of the Over-allotment Option will also be
allocated to the above purposes on a pro rata basis. In the event that the Over-allotment Option
is exercised in full, we will receive net proceeds of HK$3,480.68 million (assuming an Offer
Price of HK$19.88 per H Share, the midpoint of our indicative Offer Price range).

To the extent that the net proceeds are not immediately applied to the above purposes, we
may hold such funds in short-term deposits so long as it is deemed to be in the best interests
of the Company. In such event, we will comply with the appropriate disclosure requirements
under the Listing Rules.
