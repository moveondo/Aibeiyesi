For continuing operation, the Group has been operating in one reporting segment, being the discovery,
development and commercialisation of drugs. On April 25, 2018, the Group has entered into a contract to sell the
equity interest in the subsidiary engaged in the sales of biologic reagent, details of which are set out in Note 33 and
accordingly such operating segment has been presented as discontinued operations.

For the purpose of resources allocation and performance assessment, the Group’s chief executive officer, being
the chief operating decision maker, reviews the consolidated results when making decisions about allocating
resources and assessing performance of the Group as a whole and hence, the Group has only one reportable segment
and no further analysis of this single segment is presented.
