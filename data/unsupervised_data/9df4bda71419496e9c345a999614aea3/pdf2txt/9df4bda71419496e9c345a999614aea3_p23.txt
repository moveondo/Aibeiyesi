LISTING EXPENSES AND ISSUE COSTS

Listing expenses and issue costs represent

the professional expenses, underwriting
commissions and other expenses incurred in respect of the Listing and the Global Offering. We
expect to incur a total of approximately RMB122.6 million of listing expenses and issue costs
(assuming an Offer Price of HK$19.88, being the mid-point of the indicative Offer Price range
between HK$19.38 and HK$20.38, and assuming that
the Over-allotment Option is not
exercised at all) in relation to the Global Offering, of which RMB17.3 million was recognized
as deferred issue costs for future deduction from equity upon the Listing and RMB0.2 million
was recognized as listing expense. For the remaining listing expenses and issue costs of
approximately RMB105.1 million, an estimated amount of RMB5.4 million is expected to be
recognized as listing expenses and an estimated amount of RMB99.7 million is expected to be
recognized directly as a deduction from equity upon the Listing. The listing expenses and issue
costs above were the best estimate as of the Latest Practicable Date and were for reference only
and the actual amount may differ from this estimate. Our Directors do not expect such expenses
would have a material adverse impact on our results of operations for the year ending
December 31, 2018.
