Continue our tracking and exploratory research on potential targets suitable for the
development of macromolecular drugs and utilize advanced antibody discovery,
high-efficiency screening platforms and high-expression cell
line construction
platforms to discover and select new drug candidates;

Allocate appropriate resources to the exploration and R&D of new drug targets in
the field of small molecule and promote the R&D cooperation with excellent small
molecule drug companies; and

Conduct exploratory research in the field of cell
exploring opportunities to further expand our product pipeline.

Scale up our macromolecules fermentation capacity and lower production cost

We plan to scale up our macromolecules fermentation capacity and explore the
development of the latest fermentation process in order to lower the production cost
in
anticipation of future competition. We expect to complete the technology upgrade of the
Wujiang Production Base in 2018 and put the first two production lines of the Lingang
Production Base into production with a fermentation capacity of 12,000L by the end of 2019.
