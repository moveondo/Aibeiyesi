BUSINESS

We believe the contemplated expansion and upgrades to our manufacturing facilities will
increase the efficiency of our manufacturing processes, equip us with new manufacturing
technology for our drug candidates, satisfy the needs for large-scale commercial manufacturing
in the future, and allow us to continue to maintain an effective quality management system for
our manufacturing.

In formulating our expansion and upgrade plan, we take into consideration the R&D and
commercialization progress for our drug candidates, anticipated market demand and capital
expenditures to be incurred. We have been funding our expansion and upgrade with a
combination of equity and debt financing, and plan to use part of the proceeds from the Global
Offering to fund such expansion and upgrade. For details, see “Future Plans and Use of
Proceeds – Use of Proceeds”.

Manufacturing is subject to extensive regulations that impose various procedural and
documentation requirements governing recordkeeping, manufacturing process and controls,
personnel, quality control and quality assurance, among others. Our manufacturing facilities
are designed to operate under, and are expected to receive certifications for, cGMP
requirements.
