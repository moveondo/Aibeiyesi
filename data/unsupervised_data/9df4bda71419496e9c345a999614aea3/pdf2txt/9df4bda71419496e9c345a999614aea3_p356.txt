UNDERWRITING

Hong Kong Underwriters’ interests in our Company

Save for their obligations of the Hong Kong Underwriters under the Hong Kong
Underwriting Agreement and saved as disclosed in this prospectus, as of the Latest Practicable
Date, none of the Hong Kong Underwriters is interested directly or indirectly in any H Shares
or securities in our Company or any other member of the Group or has any right or option
(whether legally enforceable or not) to subscribe for, or to nominate persons to subscribe for,
any H Shares or securities in our Company or any other member of the Group.

Following completion of the Global Offering, the Hong Kong Underwriters and their
affiliated companies may hold a certain portion of the H Shares as a result of fulfilling their
obligations under the Hong Kong Underwriting Agreement.

The International Placing

In connection with the International Placing, it is expected that our Company will enter
into the International Underwriting Agreement with the Joint Global Coordinators (on behalf
of the International Underwriters) on or about December 17, 2018. Under the International
Underwriting Agreement and subject
the International
Underwriters would, subject to certain conditions set out therein, severally but not jointly,
agree to procure subscribers or purchasers for the International Placing Shares, failing which
they agree to subscribe for or purchase their respective proportions of the International Placing
Shares which are not taken up under the International Placing. Please refer to the section
headed “Structure of the Global Offering – The International Placing” in this prospectus for
details.

to the Over-allotment Option,

Our Company expects to grant to the International Underwriters, exercisable by the Lead
Global Coordinator (on behalf of the International Underwriters), the Over-allotment Option,
which will be exercisable from the Listing Date until 30 days after the last date for the lodging
of applications under the Hong Kong Public Offering, to require our Company to issue and
allot up to an aggregate of 23,836,500 additional H Shares, representing 15% of the total
number of Offer Shares initially available under the Global Offering, at the same price per
Offer Share under the International Placing, to, among other things, cover over-allocations in
the International Placing, if any. It is expected the International Underwriting Agreement may
be terminated on similar grounds as the Hong Kong Underwriting Agreement. Potential
investors shall be reminded that in the event that the International Underwriting Agreement is
not entered into, the Global Offering will not proceed.
