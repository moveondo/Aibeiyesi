Regulatory Progress and Next Steps

JS002 obtained IND approval from the NMPA in August 2017, being the first anti-PCSK9
monoclonal antibody to receive IND approval in the PRC. As of the Latest Practicable Date,
JS002 was under Phase I clinical trial. We plan to complete Phase I clinical trial and commence
Phase II clinical trial for primary hypercholesterolemia and mixed dyslipidemia in December
2018.

UBP1213 (anti-BLyS mAb)

UBP1213 is a recombinant humanized anti-BLyS monoclonal antibody injection, which
is being developed for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (“SLE”) and other
autoimmune diseases. We received IND approval from the NMPA in October 2016.

Mechanism of Action

BLyS is produced by macrophages, neutrophils and monocytes. It is required for the
survival of B cells. Excessive level of BLyS induces abnormally high survival of autoreactive
B cells and differentiation of B cells into antibody-producing plasma cells, which causes SLE
and other autoimmune diseases. The FDA approved BLyS inhibitor for the treatment of SLE
has shown statistically significant, albeit modest, efficacy, representing a step forward in
treating SLE.
