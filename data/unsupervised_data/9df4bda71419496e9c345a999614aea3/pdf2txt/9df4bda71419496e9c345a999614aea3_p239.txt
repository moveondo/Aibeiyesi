We commenced a technological upgrade of Wujiang Production Base in 2017, which is
expected to be completed in 2018. As part of such upgrade, we plan to introduce additional
1,500L bioreactors, thereby bringing the total fermentation capacity to 3,000L. We also plan to
install additional purification equipment, build new storage facilities and implement other
enhancements to the existing manufacturing lines.

Lingang Production Base

Lingang Production Base is located in Lingang Industrial Park, Fengxian District,
Shanghai. Its construction started in 2017 in accordance with cGMP standards. Lingang
Production Base occupies a site area of 53,334.4 sq.m. Phase I of the Lingang Production Base
has a planned fermentation capability of 24,000L. We expect the first two production lines of
Lingang Production Base to commence operation with 12,000L fermentation capability by the
end of 2019.

Below is a photograph of our Lingang Production Base under construction.

Our bioreactors in our Wujiang and Lingang Production Bases use the single-use
bioprocessing technology, which has emerged as a standard platform for cGMP mammalian cell
culture with the benefits of lower capital and operating costs, reduced contamination risk,
continuity from early development through manufacturing, flexibility, and sustainability.
