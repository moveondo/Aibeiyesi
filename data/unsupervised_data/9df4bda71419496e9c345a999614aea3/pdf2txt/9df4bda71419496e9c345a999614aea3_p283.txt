DIRECTORS, SUPERVISORS AND SENIOR MANAGEMENT

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

Our Company intends to comply with all code provisions under

the Corporate

Governance Code after the Listing.

Our corporate management structure consists of our Board and our senior management,
and our executive Directors and our senior management are primarily responsible for our
operations. Our non-executive Directors reinforce the supervisory function of our Board and
do not take part in our day-to-day operations. Our independent non-executive Directors provide
an independent opinion and judgment to our Board, and to give our Company the benefit of
their skills, expertise and background.

Further, to effectively manage the potential conflict of interests and competition between
our Directors, Supervisors or members of our senior management and our Group and to
safeguard the interests of our Shareholders taken as a whole, our Company has put in place
corporate governance measures including:

(a)

(b)

(c)

(d)

our Articles of Association provide that any Director, Supervisor and senior
management member should not place himself/herself in a position where his/her
duty and his/her own interests may conflict. Directors are also required to declare
their interests. In the event of a conflict of interest arising out of any transactions
to be entered into by our Group, any Directors (including independent non-executive
Directors) with conflicting interest shall be excluded from and abstain from voting
in respect of such transactions and shall not be counted in forming a quorum at the
relevant Board meetings;

our Board currently includes five independent non-executive Directors, each having
extensive experience in different areas and are professionals in different industries.
We believe that they singly and jointly will be able to exercise their independent
judgment and will be able to provide impartial opinions in the decision-making
process of our Board to protect the interests of our Shareholders;

each of our Directors is aware of his fiduciary duties as a director, which require,
among other things, that he acts for our Company’s benefit and best interests and he
must not allow any conflict between his duties as a Director and his personal
interests;

technology and intellectual property rights,

as part of his fiduciary duties as a Director, he owes a duty of confidentiality towards
our Company and must not use our Company’s confidential information, including
our
for his own benefit. Their
confidentiality obligation is further reinforced in the service contracts between us
and our Directors (including our independent non-executive Directors), that they
shall not, among other things, disclose any confidential information they obtained to
any third party, and must not use such in any way for the benefit of themselves or
any third party at any time during and after their tenure;
