Results. Of the 33 patients enrolled, 27 evaluable patients received at least one efficacy
evaluation and 8 PR and 13 SD were observed, with the ORR of 29.6% (8/27) and the DCR
of 77.8% (21/27).

Safety. Most of the TRAEs were Grade 1-2, including ALT increase, hyperglycemia,

amylase increase, anemia, AST increase and hypothyroidism.

Advanced Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma (Phase Ib/II)

Design. Patients received a 3 mg/kg JS001 infusion every two weeks and were evaluated
by investigators for clinical efficacy every eight weeks in accordance with the RECIST v1.1
assessment criteria. Between April 19, 2017 and August 31, 2017, 59 patients with advanced
esophageal squamous cell carcinoma were enrolled into the study. As of December 30, 2017,
48 patients received at least one evaluation of efficacy.

Results. Of the 48 patients evaluated, there were 1 case of CR, 10 cases of PR and 13

cases of SD, with the ORR of 22.9% (11/48) and the DCR of 50.0% (24/48).

Safety. TEAEs were reported in 56 (94.9%) of 59 patients, any grade TRAEs were
reported in 37 (62.7%). TRAEs occurred were mostly grade 1 or 2. Grade 3-5 TRAEs occurred
in 22 (37.3%) patients. Any grade of immune related AEs occurred in 6 (10.2%) patients. The
most common AEs are weight decrease, anemia, cough, constipation, pyrexia, ALT increase,
nausea, AST increase, decreased appetite and WBC decrease. Grade 3 to 5 TRAEs mainly
include anaemia, increased bilirubin conjugated, hyponatraemia and dysphagia. 10 (16.9%)
subjects terminated due to TEAE.
