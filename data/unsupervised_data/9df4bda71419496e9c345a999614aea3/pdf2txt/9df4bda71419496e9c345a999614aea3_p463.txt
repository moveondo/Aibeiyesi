APPENDIX I

Liquidity risk

ACCOUNTANTS’ REPORT

In the management of the liquidity risk, the Group monitors and maintains a level of cash and cash
equivalents as well as undrawn banking facilities deemed adequate by the directors of the Company to finance
the Group’s operations and mitigate the effects of fluctuations in cash flows.

The Group relied on borrowings, convertible loan notes and the issuance of ordinary shares as a

significant source of liquidity. Details of which are set out in Note 26, Note 27 and Note 30.

The following table details the Group and the Company’s remaining contractual maturity for its
non-derivative financial liabilities. The table has been drawn up based on the undiscounted cash flows of
financial liabilities based on the earliest date on which the Group can be required to pay. The table includes
both interest and principal cash flows.

In addition, the following table details the Group and the Company’s liquidity analysis for its derivative
financial instruments. The tables have been drawn up based on the undiscounted gross (inflows) and outflows
on those derivatives that require gross settlement. The liquidity analysis for the Group and the Company’s
derivative financial instruments are prepared based on the contractual maturities as the management considers
that the contractual maturities are essential for an understanding of the timing of the cash flows of derivatives.
