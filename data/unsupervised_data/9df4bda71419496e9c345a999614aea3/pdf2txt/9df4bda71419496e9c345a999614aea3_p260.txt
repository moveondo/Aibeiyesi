CONNECTED TRANSACTIONS

Annual caps and basis

Our proposed annual caps in respect of the transactions contemplated under the Technical
Development Engagement Framework Agreement are RMB16 million, RMB16.25 million and
RMB20 million for the three years ending December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively.

In estimating the annual caps, our Directors considered the following factors: (i) the
historical research fees and remuneration paid to Beijing Zhengdan and its associates during
the Track Record Period; (ii) the expected progress of research to be made by Beijing
Zhengdan and its associates for the three years ending December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020,
particularly regarding the sample analysis in relation to anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody and
anti-PCSK9 monoclonal antibody which are expected to be commercialised during the term of
the Technical Development Engagement Framework Agreement if all necessary approval is
obtained; (iii) the estimated increase in our demand for pharmaceutical research and technical
development services; and (iv) the prevailing market prices for comparable pharmaceutical
research and technical development services from Independent Third Parties.

In the coming years ahead, we aim to accelerate our R&D progress and commercialization
process. Among others, in this year and the next two years, (i) we are preparing to launch JS001
in the PRC shortly after obtaining NDA approval, and to kick off Phase II and III clinical trials
for cardiovascular indications for JS002 in late 2018, (ii) we plan to launch a global large-scale
pivotal clinical trial for JS001, to file UBP1211, and to commence patient enrollment for Phase
I clinical trial of UBP1213 in 2019, and (iii) we aim to launch UBP1211 in 2020 if NDA
approval is obtained. We are also rapidly expanding our product pipeline. To pave way for the
above and to implement our plans and strategies, we expect to broaden the scale and scope of
our trials and to increase the number of trials, especially clinical trials for JS001, UBP1211,
JS002 and UBP1213, to be conducted considerably in the years 2018 to 2020 when compared
the Track Record Period. Accordingly, we estimate that our demand for
to those of
pharmaceutical
for
biological samples from clinical trials and from non-clinical trials would increase substantially
when compared to our Track Record Period.

Reasons for and benefits of entering into the Technical Development Engagement
Framework Agreement

Our Directors believe that engaging Beijing Zhengdan and/or its associates for the
provision of pharmaceutical research and technical development services is fair and reasonable
and in the interests of our Group and our Shareholders as a whole for the following reasons:
(i) Beijing Zhengdan and its associate(s) possess the expertise in pharmaceutical research and
technical development services and we can make use of their resources in order to accelerate
the progress of R&D of our drug candidates in order to achieve their commercialization; (ii)
in the forthcoming years covered under the Technical Development Engagement Framework
Agreement, we plan to commercialize certain of our drug candidates if approval is obtained,
as further described above and in the section headed “Business” in this prospectus. On the path
to commercialization, we anticipate an increasing need for sample analysis and other types of
