INDUSTRY OVERVIEW

Competitive landscape

The three marketed anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibodies in the global biologics market are
Opdivo, Keytruda and Libtayo. From 2014 to 2017, sales revenue of Opdivo and Keytruda
increased from USD20 million to USD5,753 million and from USD55 million to USD3,809
million, respectively. Main factors driving their growth include the increasing recognition of
treatment value and expansion of indications for PD-1 inhibitors.

The three marketed anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies are Tecentriq, Bavencio and
Imfinzi. Due to the relatively late launch of PD-L1 inhibitors and limited indications, the
global sales revenue of PD-L1 inhibitors reached only USD160 million and USD537 million
in 2016 and 2017, respectively. The sales revenue is expected to surge up with expansion of
indications in the future.

As of the Latest Practicable Date, both Keytruda and Opdivo had received NDA approval
from the NMPA. In addition, four PRC companies have filed the NDAs. All these four PD-1
inhibitors by PRC companies are expected to be marketed in 2019. The following table sets
forth the information about the PD-1 products that have been approved by or have filed the
NDAs to the NMPA, with our Company being the first PRC company to file a PD-1 inhibitor
NDA in China:

The first few marketed drugs in a class tend to have a better performance and a larger
market share because physicians will have more experience in the usage of these drugs and may
be more likely to prescribe them. The longer the lead time before the entry of rivals, the higher
the likelihood of achieving the first-mover advantages. In the long run, pricing will also play
a significant role in terms of market penetration.

ANTI-PCSK9 THERAPY

Cardiovascular diseases are chronic diseases and remain the leading cause of death for
human populations globally. Hypercholesterolemia has been a big issue in the PRC. It has been
increasingly prevalent in recent years due to unhealthy diet, absence of exercise and population
aging. The prevalence of hypercholesterolemia grew from 66.8 million in 2013 to 79.3 million
in 2017, and is expected to further increase to 95.9 million in 2022. PCSK9 inhibitors for the
treatment of hypercholesterolemia have been demonstrated to be effective for lowering LDL-C
levels and benefit other patients at risk for cardiovascular diseases.

Global market size of PCSK9 inhibitors

As of the Latest Practicable Date,

there had been two PCSK9 inhibitors marketed
globally. The global PCSK9 inhibitors market reached USD0.5 billion in 2017, representing a
CAGR of 406.7% from 2015 to 2017. Driven by a combination of factors including large
addressable patient pool, excellent clinical results and increased market penetration, PCSK9
inhibitors market is expected to grow rapidly in the following years to USD5.2 billion in 2022
and USD12.1 billion in 2030, respectively.
