Approximately 25% of the net proceeds, or HK$755.27 million, will be used for our
investment
in
particular companies with strong R&D and/or commercialization capabilities that
are complementary to our Company. As of the Latest Practicable Date, we have not
identified any specific targets, or adopted a concrete timetable or expected capital
expenditure plan to implement any acquisition, and we have not entered into any
letter of intent or agreement in relation to any acquisition; and

Approximately 10% of the net proceeds, or HK$302.11 million, will be used for our
working capital and other general corporate purposes.

The above allocation of the proceeds will be adjusted on a pro rata basis in the event that
the Offer Price is fixed below or above the midpoint of the indicative price range. Any
additional proceeds received from the exercise of the Over-allotment Option will also be
allocated to the above purposes on a pro rata basis. In the event that the Over-allotment Option
is exercised in full, we will receive net proceeds of HK$3,480.68 million (assuming an Offer
Price of HK$19.88 per H Share, the midpoint of our indicative Offer Price range).

To the extent that the net proceeds are not immediately applied to the above purposes, we
may hold such funds in short-term deposits so long as it is deemed to be in the best interests
of the Company. In such event, we will comply with the appropriate disclosure requirements
under the Listing Rules.
