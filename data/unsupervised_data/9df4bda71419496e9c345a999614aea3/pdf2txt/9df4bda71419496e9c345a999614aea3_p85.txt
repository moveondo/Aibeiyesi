fixed assets or employee injuries, or product liability in the future. Any liability or damage to,
or caused by, our facilities or our personnel beyond our insurance coverage may result in our
incurring substantial costs and a diversion of resources.

We may pursue collaborations,
joint ventures, strategic
alliances, partnerships or other strategic investment or arrangements, which may fail to
produce anticipated benefits and adversely affect our business.

in-licensing,

We are collaborating with third party pharmaceutical companies such as CSPC and Betta.
See “Business – Cooperation with Third Parties”. We may pursue other opportunities for
collaboration,
joint ventures, acquisitions of products, assets or technology,
strategic alliances, or partnerships that we believe would be complementary to or promote our
existing business. Proposing, negotiating and implementing these opportunities may be a
lengthy and complex process. Other companies, including those with substantially greater
financial, marketing, sales, technology, or other business resources, may compete with us for
these opportunities or arrangements. We may not be able to identify, secure, or complete any
such transactions or arrangements in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis, on acceptable
terms, or at all.

We have limited experience with respect

to these business development activities.
Management and integration of a licensing arrangement, collaboration, joint venture or other
strategic arrangement may disrupt our current operations, decrease our profitability, result in
significant expenses, or divert management resources that otherwise would be available for our
existing business. We may not realize the anticipated benefits of any such transaction or
arrangement.

Furthermore, partners, collaborators or other parties to such transactions or arrangements
may fail to fully, or at all, perform their obligations or meet our expectations or cooperate with
us satisfactorily for various reasons, including risks or uncertainties related to their business
and operations. There may be conflicts or other collaboration failures and inefficiencies
between us and the other parties.

Such transactions or arrangements may also require actions, consents, approvals, waivers,
participation or involvement of various degrees from third parties, such as regulators,
government authorities, creditors,
related individuals, suppliers,
distributors, shareholders or other stakeholders or interested parties. There is no assurance that
such third parties will be cooperative as we desire, or at all, in which case we may be unable
to carry out the relevant transactions or arrangements.
