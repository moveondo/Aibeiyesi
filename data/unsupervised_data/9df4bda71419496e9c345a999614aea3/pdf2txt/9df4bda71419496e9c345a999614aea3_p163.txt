OUR HISTORY AND DEVELOPMENT

The initial conversion price of the 2018 Convertible Bonds was RMB25 per Domestic
Share represented a premium of approximately 31.44% over the then prevailing closing price
of our Share quoted on NEEQ on October 24, 2017, being the last trading date of the Shares
on NEEQ before the determination of the initial conversion price. The initial conversion price
and such premium was determined after arm’s length negotiation between our Company and
Shanghai Tanying with reference to the expected return from interests payment at the rate of
10.35% per annum if holder(s) of the 2018 Convertible Bonds elects to hold the 2018
Convertible Bonds to maturity, the expected growth of our Company, and the dilutive effect
from the conversion in light of our funding needs in the principal amount of RMB200 million.
The conversion price of the 2018 Convertible Bonds shall be adjusted upon occurrence of
certain events, including distributions to shareholders, issue or placing of shares etc., which
result in a change in our Company’s share capital. As of the Latest Practicable Date, RMB200
million of these 2018 Convertible Bonds were outstanding and convertible into 8,061,265
Domestic Shares at the conversion price of RMB24.81 per Domestic Share and were held by
Shanghai Tanying. Upon Listing, subject to the terms and conversion restrictions of the 2018
Convertible Bonds, the conversion price and number of Domestic Shares into which the
outstanding 2018 Convertible Bonds may be converted will be adjusted as follows:
