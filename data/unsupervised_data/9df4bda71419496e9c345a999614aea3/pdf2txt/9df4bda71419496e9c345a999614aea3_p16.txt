Summary Data from Consolidated Statements of Profit or Loss

During the Track Record Period, we had not commercialized any drugs and therefore did
not record any revenue from drug product sales. We derived our revenue from consulting and
research services income through fee-for-service contracts. We recognized revenue of
continuing operations of approximately RMB3.8 million, RMB1.1 million, RMB1.1 million
and nil for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2017 and the six months ended June 30,
2017 and 2018, respectively. On April 25, 2018, we entered into an agreement to dispose all
of our equity interest in our then subsidiary, Beijing Xinjingke Biotechnology, which mainly
engaged in the business of sales of biological reagents. The assets and liabilities of Beijing
Xinjingke Biotechnology have been classified as a disposal entity held for sale and the
comparative figures in the consolidated statements of profit or loss and other comprehensive
income have been presented separately to represent
the business of Beijing Xinjingke
Biotechnology as discontinued operations as at June 30, 2018.
