Under the law of the PRC Enterprise Income Tax (the “EIT Law”) and implementation regulations of the EIT

During the nine months ended September 30, 2017, the United States (the “US”) federal imposed progressive
corporate income tax rates ranging from 15% to 35%. The US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Act”) was enacted into law
on December 22, 2017. The Act includes significant changes to the US corporate income tax system that have become
effective on January 1, 2018, including a reduction of the US corporate income tax rate to a flat rate of 21%.

TopAlliance Biosciences Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, is subject to the US State Income
tax rate of 8.84% for both periods. No provision for taxation in the US has been made as TopAlliance Biosciences
Inc. has no assessable profit for both periods.

DISCONTINUED OPERATION AND DISPOSAL OF A SUBSIDIARY

In April 2018, the shareholder of Beijing Junke Jingde Biotechnology Co., Ltd. resolved to dispose the segment
of sales of biological reagent. The Group entered into a sales and purchase agreement with an independent third party
to dispose of its entire interest
in Beijing Xinjingke Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (the “Xinjingke”) for a cash
consideration of RMB2,000,000 (the “Disposal”). The Disposal was completed on June 29, 2018, on which date
control of Xinjingke was passed to the acquirer. The reason for the Disposal was that the Group can concentrate its
resources on development and documentation of drugs.

The results of the discontinued sales of biological reagent operations for the nine months ended September 30,
2018, which were included in the condensed consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive
income, were as follows:
