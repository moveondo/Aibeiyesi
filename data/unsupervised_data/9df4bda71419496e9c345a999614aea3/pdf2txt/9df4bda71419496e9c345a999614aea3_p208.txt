Results. Among all 33 subjects, 6 achieved CR, 10 achieved PR and 12 achieved SD, for
an ORR of 48.5%. The mTTR was 10.6 (5.3 – 35.7) weeks, and the mPFS was 8.8 (1.3 – 14.0+)
months. Among 7 NSCLC subjects, 2 PR were observed, yielding an ORR of 28.6%.

Safety. The most common TRAEs were grade 1 or 2.

Next Steps. We are conducting a multi-center, single arm phase II study to evaluate the
efficacy and safety of JS001 in combination with pemetrexed plus carboplatin for treatment of
recurrent or advanced EGFR-mutation positive NSCLC without T790M mutation that have
failed prior EGFR-TKI treatment. The planned enrollment is 40 subjects in total.

Combination Therapies of JS001

In addition to monotherapies, PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors have shown significant potential in
combination therapies according to the F&S Report. As described above, we are conducting the
JS001+Axitinib combination therapy clinical trial for metastatic mucosal melanoma through
purchasing Axitinib from the open market. In addition, we are cooperating with third party
pharmaceutical companies to develop other combination therapies.

Market Opportunity and Competition

According to the F&S Report, the market size of PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors together is
projected to reach to RMB37.4 billion in 2022, representing a CAGR of 534.4% between 2018
and 2022, and further increase to RMB98.4 billion in 2030, representing a CAGR of 12.8%
between 2022 and 2030. In particular, it is expected that anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibodies
produced by PRC companies will achieve rapid growth upon their commercialization as a
result of more affordable prices, commanding a market share of 70.0% in 2030.

Currently, there are significant unmet medical needs for anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody
drugs, while JS001 has the potential to be the first NMPA-approved anti-PD-1 drug developed
by a PRC company benefiting from its advanced clinical progress. In view of the retail prices
of Opdivo and Keytruda as shown in the table below, we plan to price our JS001 competitively
taking into account the market conditions. We believe that JS001, as a pioneer in the market
with proven efficacy and affordable price compared with its MNC competitors, will be able to
enjoy a significant market share and strong competitive position upon commercialization. In
addition, driven by the growing number of oncological patients, the increasing recognition of
the treatment, the additional indications approved, the increased efficacy and sales resulted
from combination therapies, as well as the gradual expansion of medical insurance coverage in
the PRC, we believe the demand for JS001 will continue to grow.
