ANTI-BLyS THERAPY

Systemic lupus erythematosus (“SLE”) is a multisystem autoimmune disease affecting a
population of more than 8.0 million in the world, for which there is no clear cause or cure. The
prevalence of SLE in the PRC grew steadily, with the number of patients reaching 1,043,200
in 2017 and 1,073,200 in 2022.

Global market size of BLyS inhibitors

There has been only one BLyS inhibitor specifically developed and approved for SLE in
the past 50 years. The global BLyS inhibitors market reached USD0.5 billion in 2017, and is
expected to grow to USD2.9 billion in 2022 and USD8.8 billion in 2030, respectively.

Potential market size of BLyS inhibitors in the PRC

According to the F&S Report, the first BLyS inhibitor is estimated to be commercialized
in the PRC in 2019. Addressable patients for anti-BLyS products include all SLE patients
except for the patients with severe active lupus nephritis or severe active central nervous
system lupus, and was 90.2% in PRC in 2017. Benefiting from the large addressable patient
pool without effective treatment regime, excellent clinical results and expansion of coverage
by third-party payers in the PRC, the market of PRC BLyS inhibitors is expected to reach
RMB0.7 billion in 2022 and further increase to RMB10.2 billion in 2030.
