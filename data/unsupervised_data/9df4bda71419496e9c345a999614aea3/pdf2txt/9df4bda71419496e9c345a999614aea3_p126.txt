MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES

Monoclonal antibodies bind to the ligand or receptor that is expressed on the cell surface,
thereby inhibiting the binding between such ligand and its specific receptor, blocking the target
signalling pathway and preventing downstream effects . Monoclonal antibodies and mAb-like
drugs are the largest segment of the global biologics market in 2017, representing a 43.2%
market share by sales revenue. Monoclonal antibodies are widely used in different therapeutic

Global market size of PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors

PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors are emerging immunotherapies in cancer treatment. There are
currently three PD-1 inhibitors and three PD-L1 inhibitors marketed worldwide. The global
PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors market has experienced rapid growth ever since the first anti-PD-1
monoclonal antibody was commercially launched, and the market size will continue to grow in
the next ten years due to the expansion of indications and launch of combination therapies.
Sales revenue of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors in the global market increased at a CAGR of 154.2%
from USD1.6 billion in 2015 to USD10.1 billion in 2017, and is expected to further increase
to USD78.9 billion in 2030. See below table setting forth historical and forecast global
PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors market size starting from 2015, the first full year of PD-1 sales.
