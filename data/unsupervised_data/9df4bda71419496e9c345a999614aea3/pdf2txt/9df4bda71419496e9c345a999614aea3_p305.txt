On February 28, 2017, our Group entered into an agreement with Jiangsu T-mab Biopharma Co., Ltd (江
蘇泰康生物醫藥有限公司) (“T-mab”), pursuant to which our Group provided T-mab with know-how and
consulting services to build up a certificate of cGMP compliant facility. All performance obligations
were completed in 2017 and therefore our Group recognized approximately RMB10.8 million as service
income in 2017.

On August 28, 2017, our Group and T-mab entered into a co-development and commercialisation
agreement (the “Collaboration Agreement”) for UBP1211, a biosimilar our Group originally had sole
ownership of patents and know-how. Under the terms of the Collaboration Agreement, the patents and
know-how from the research and development of UBP1211 will be registered under the name of both
parties while all future research and development costs and net profit from sales of UBP1211 upon
successful commercialisation will be evenly shared between our Group and T-mab. Our Group has joint
control over the arrangement that unanimous consent is required from all parties to the agreement for
relevant activities including clinical studies, manufacturing and marketing. As such, our Group
accounted for the arrangement as joint operation. A non-refundable consideration of approximately
RMB36.6 million received upon the signing of the Collaboration Agreement from T-mab on passing
T-mab the right to access the know-how of UBP1211 was recognized in other income.

As part of the Collaboration Agreement, T-mab also granted our Group a loan commitment of RMB60.0
million at the benchmark borrowing rate of the People’s Bank of China plus 30% premium with
expiration date of August 27, 2019. As at June 30, 2018, RMB20.0 million of the loan commitment was
utilized by our Group. For further information, please refer to Note 26 of the Accountants’ Report in
