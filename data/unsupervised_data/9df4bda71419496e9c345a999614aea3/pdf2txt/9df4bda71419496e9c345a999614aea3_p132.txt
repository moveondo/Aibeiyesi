The key assumption of these estimates is that the retail price of belimumab in China will be 60% of that
in the U.S.

The estimates have not taken into account off-label prescriptions.

Competitive landscape

As of the Latest Practicable Date, there was only one marketed BLyS inhibitor globally
while more than five BLyS inhibitors were under different phases of clinical trials globally.
Two pharmaceutical companies have obtained IND approvals from the NMPA for monoclonal
antibody BLyS inhibitor and one for fusion protein BLyS inhibitor. The following table sets
forth the information about monoclonal antibody BLyS inhibitors under clinical trials in the
PRC, with our Company being the only PRC company to obtain IND approval regarding a
monoclonal antibody BLyS inhibitor in China:
