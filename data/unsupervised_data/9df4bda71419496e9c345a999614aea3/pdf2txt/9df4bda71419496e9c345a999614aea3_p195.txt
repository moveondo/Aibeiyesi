We encountered and expect to continue to encounter AEs in our clinical trials. All AEs are
followed until they are resolved, patient is deceased or patient is out of trial for 90 days. All
AEs are managed and treated according to the clinical protocol and investigator’s brochure.
The clinical protocol, investigator’s brochure and SAE case report of each clinical study on
JS001 as disclosed in this prospectus have been communicated to and confirmed with the
relevant ethical committees of clinical trial sites. Based on data from our clinical trials,
publicly available information of competitor drugs and consultation with Frost & Sullivan, we
are of the view that the AE, SAE, irAE and TRAE profiles of JS001 for the indications set out
below are generally in line with those of competitor drugs.

1.

Recurrent Metastatic Lymphoma (Phase I)

Design. In the Phase I clinical trial of recurrent metastatic lymphoma, a total of 24
patients (17 HL and seven NHL) received a JS001 infusion every two weeks and were
evaluated by investigators for clinical efficacy every six weeks in accordance with the IWG
International lymphoma assessment criteria.

Results. As of June 28, 2018, all patients underwent at

least a half-year follow-up
evaluation. The following table sets forth the results of Phase I clinical trial of JS001 in the
treatment of recurrent metastatic lymphoma.

Of the three SD patients observed, two had unconfirmed partial response. The mTTR was
42 days with the range of 42 to 210 days. As at the cut-off date for data collection, 14 out of
18 patients with objective response were still in sustained response, and the mDOR and mPFS
had not been reached. JS001 shows long-lasting efficacy in recurrent metastatic lymphoma.
