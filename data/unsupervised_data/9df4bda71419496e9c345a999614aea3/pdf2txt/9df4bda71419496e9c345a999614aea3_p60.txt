RISK FACTORS

We may not be able to continue to enjoy certain preferential tax treatments.

We enjoy certain preferential tax treatments. In particular, pursuant to Caishui [2015]
circular No. 119, our Company and our three subsidiaries Jiangsu Union Biopharm, Suzhou
Junmeng and Junshi Biotechnology enjoyed super deduction of 150% on qualifying research
and development expenditures throughout
the Track Record Period. For the years ended
December 31, 2016 and 2017 and the six months ended June 30, 2018, our qualifying research
and development expenditures amounted to RMB39.9 million, RMB167.6 million and
RMB147.9 million, respectively. During the same period, we enjoyed an additional deduction
of RMB5.0 million, RMB21.0 million and RMB18.5 million, respectively, arising from the tax
effects on the aforementioned qualifying research and development expenditures. There is no
assurance that we will continue to be qualified to enjoy such super deduction or other
preferential tax treatments, or such treatments will not change in the future, which may have
a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We are subject to the risk of inventories obsolescence.

Our

inventories increased significantly from approximately RMB7.1 million as at
December 31, 2016 to approximately RMB30.6 million as at December 31, 2017, and further
increased to approximately RMB46.9 million as at June 30, 2018, mainly because we increased
our purchase volumes of raw materials and consumables in line with our clinical trial progress
and for NDA filing purpose. Such inventories mainly include raw materials, which accounted
for 64.7%, 94.4% and 100.0% of our total inventories as at December 31, 2016 and 2017 and
June 30, 2018, with the remainder being finished goods. As of November 30, 2018, 47.0% of
our inventories as of June 30, 2018 had been utilized. In the event that a significant portion of
our inventories becomes obsolete, this may have a negative impact on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

We are exposed to fair value change for convertible loan notes and valuation uncertainty
due to the use of unobservable inputs.

We are exposed to fair value change for convertible loan notes and valuation uncertainty
due to the use of unobservable inputs. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2017 and
the six months ended June 30, 2018, we recorded loss on fair value changes of convertible loan
notes measured at FVTPL of nil, nil and RMB9.6 million, respectively. For the valuation of
convertible loan notes designated at FVTPL, we used Binomial option pricing model, the key
inputs of which are underlying share price, conversion price, discount rate, expected volatility,
debt yield and risk-free rate. Further, the valuation of convertible loan notes designated at
FVTPL involves significant unobservable inputs including expected volatility and discount
rate. Such exposure to fair value change for convertible loan notes and valuation uncertainty
due to the use of unobservable inputs may have a negative impact on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.
