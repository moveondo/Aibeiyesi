Market drivers of PRC biologics market

Enlarging patient pool. In the PRC, the disease spectrum is transforming from infectious
diseases to chronic diseases, among which oncological diseases are getting increasingly
prevalent. Incidence of cancers has achieved 4.2 million in 2017 and is projected to reach 4.8
million in 2022. The cancer treatment features high cost and long-term medication demand.
Since biologics have demonstrated good efficacy in the treatment of an increasing number of
diseases with long-term medication need, the increasing prevalence of chronic diseases such as
cancers is expected to spur the demands for biologics.

Increasing capital investment. The biologics market is capital-intensive and requires
heavy investment in both R&D and manufacturing process. Capital investment in the PRC
pharmaceutical industry in 2017 has achieved USD24.9 billion, accounting for 22.2% of the
global investment. The investment has provided abundant capital for biologics R&D and
construction of manufacturing facilities.

Favorable policies. The PRC government promulgated a series of policies to speed up the
review and approval process for innovative drugs. In addition, priority review is implemented,
which accelerates the commercialization process for drugs with potential to address urgent
clinical need. Patent protection is greatly enhanced as well. Such reforms will attract
multinational pharmaceutical companies to market more innovative biologics in the PRC
market and stimulate domestic players to invest more on R&D. Consequently, available
biologics become increasingly diverse and boost consumption in the future.

Increasing affordability and healthcare awareness. Biologics that feature strong efficacy
and fewer side effects are normally priced at a much higher level compared with their chemical
counterparts. The continuous increase of disposable income of residents due to economic
growth keeps increasing has a positive effect on the health awareness and purchasing
willingness. Moreover, updated China’s National Reimbursement Drug List and price
negotiation mechanism include more biologics for reimbursement, which has further expanded
the biologics market.
PRC biosimilar market

The PRC biosimilar market remained relatively small in recent years, growing from
RMB0.7 billion in 2013 to RMB1.2 billion in 2017. The growth of such market is projected to
accelerate significantly with a CAGR of 70.9% from 2017 to 2022, reaching RMB16.9 billion
in 2022. The significant projected acceleration of the PRC biosimilar market will be driven by
(i) the growth of biologics market in the PRC generally along with the aging of the population,
the rising of chronic diseases and the improving R&D and manufacturing capabilities of PRC
biopharmaceutical companies; (ii) the cost advantage of biosimilars that allows them to reach
wider groups of patients and enhances the likelihood of their inclusion in the medical insurance
reimbursement lists in China in the near future; (iii) the recent establishment of regulatory
pathways in the PRC for biosimilars and favourable government policies encouraging
biosimilars; and (iv) a large number of blockbuster biologics with near-term or mid-term
expiration.
