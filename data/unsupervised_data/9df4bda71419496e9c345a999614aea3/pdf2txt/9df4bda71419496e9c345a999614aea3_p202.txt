Refractory or Metastatic Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma (Phase II)

Design. Patients received a 3 mg/kg JS001 infusion every two weeks and were evaluated
by the independent evaluation committee for clinical efficacy every eight weeks in accordance
with the RECIST v1.1 assessment criteria. 57 patients with advanced nasopharyngeal cancer
were treated with JS001. 39 patients underwent at least one efficacy evaluation.

Results. Of the 39 patients evaluated, 12 cases of PR and 13 cases of SD were observed
with the ORR of 30.8% (12/39) and the DCR of 64.1% (25/39). It showed that the efficacy in
PD-L1 positive tumor patients was better than in the negative patients. The ORR and DCR of
PD-L1 positive tumor patients were 42.1% and 73.7%, respectively.

Safety. The overall safety profile of JS001 observed in NPC cohorts was generally
manageable, reversible and of low severity. The most commonly reported TRAEs were pyrexia,
anemia, hypothyroidism, hypoalbuminemia, cough, leukopenia, abnormal hepatic function,
increased blood bilirubin and asthenia. The majority of TRAEs were grade 1 or 2 in severity.
Four (7.4%) subjects terminated due to TEAE. Grade 3 to 5 TRAEs mainly include anaemia,
pyrexia, decreased white blood cell count, asthenia, increased blood bilirubin and nausea.
