WAIVERS FROM STRICT COMPLIANCE WITH THE LISTING RULES AND

EXEMPTIONS FROM STRICT COMPLIANCE WITH THE COMPANIES

(WINDING UP AND MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS) ORDINANCE

WAIVER IN RELATION TO MANAGEMENT PRESENCE

Pursuant to Rules 8.12 and 19A.15 of the Listing Rules, we must have a sufficient
management presence in Hong Kong. This normally means that at least two of our executive
Directors must be ordinarily resident in Hong Kong. Since the business operations of our
Group are substantially in the PRC, with part of its R&D located in the United States, and all
of our executive Directors and senior management ordinarily reside outside Hong Kong, we do
not have, and for the foreseeable future will not have, sufficient management presence in Hong
Kong for the purpose of satisfying the requirements under Rules 8.12 and 19A.15 of the Listing
Rules. Accordingly, we have applied for, and the Stock Exchange has granted, a waiver from
strict compliance with the requirements under Rules 8.12 and 19A.15 of the Listing Rules on
the condition of the following arrangements for maintaining regular communication with the
Stock Exchange:

(a) we have appointed Dr. Li Ning, an executive Director, and Ms. Chen Yingge, a joint
company secretary of our Company, as authorized representatives of our Company
for the purpose of Rules 3.05 and 19A.07 of the Listing Rules to serve as our
principal channel of communication with the Stock Exchange. We have provided the
Stock Exchange with the contact details of these authorized representatives, and
they can be readily contactable to deal promptly with inquiries from the Stock
Exchange, and will also be available to meet with the Stock Exchange to discuss any
matters on short notice. As and when the Stock Exchange wishes to contact the
Directors on any matters, both of these authorized representatives have the means
for contacting all Directors (including the independent non-executive Directors)
promptly at all times;

(b) we have implemented such measures that (i) each Director must provide his mobile
phone number, office phone number, facsimile number and email address to these
authorized representatives; and (ii) in the event that a Director expects to travel or
otherwise be out of the office, he will provide the phone number of the place of his
accommodation to these authorized representatives;

(c) we have provided the Stock Exchange with the contact details of each Director
(including their respective mobile phone number, office telephone number, fax
number and e-mail address) to facilitate communication with the Stock Exchange.
Furthermore, each Director who is not ordinarily resident in Hong Kong possesses
or is able to apply for valid travel documents to visit Hong Kong and is able to meet
with the Stock Exchange within a reasonable period after receiving requests from
the Stock Exchange; and
