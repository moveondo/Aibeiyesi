RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

Since June 30, 2018 and up to the date of this prospectus, we continue to engage in R&D

of our drug candidates, which is in line with the past trend and our expectation.

We expect that our loss and total comprehensive expenses for the year ending December
31, 2018 will increase comparing to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to the
expected increase in research and development expenses especially on the clinical trials and
development of the current pipeline candidates. While we had net cash outflow and net losses
during the Track Record Period, we believe that the proceeds from the Global Offering,
together with our cash and cash equivalents and other financial assets, will provide us with
sufficient working capital to cover at least 125% of our costs, including general, administrative
and operating costs, as well as research and development costs, for at least 12 months from the
date of this prospectus.

USE OF PROCEEDS

Assuming the Over-allotment Option is not exercised and assuming the Offer Price is
fixed at HK$19.88 per H Share (being the mid-point of the indicative range of the Offer Price
of HK$19.38 to HK$20.38 per H Share), we estimate that the net proceeds of the Global
Offering, after deducting the estimated underwriting fees and expenses payable by us in
connection with the Global Offering, will be approximately HK$3,021.06 million.

We intend to use the net proceeds from the Global Offering for the purposes and in the

amounts set out below:
