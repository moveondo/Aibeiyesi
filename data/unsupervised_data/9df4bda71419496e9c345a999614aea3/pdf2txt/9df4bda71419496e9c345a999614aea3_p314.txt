FINANCIAL INFORMATION

Loss for the period from continuing operations

As a result of the foregoing, loss for the period from continuing operations increased by
76.6% from approximately RMB154.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017 to
approximately RMB272.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018.

Year Ended December 31, 2017 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2016

Revenue

Our revenue from consultancy fee income decreased by 71.1% from approximately
RMB3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to approximately RMB1.1 million for
the year ended December 31, 2017, mainly because (i) we provided less consulting and
research services to our customers in 2017 which were one-off contract based service; and (ii)
there was a greater focus on clinical research study of our drug candidates in 2017.

Cost of sales

Our cost of sales decreased by 60.0% from approximately RMB1.0 million for the year
ended December 31, 2016 to approximately RMB0.4 million for the year ended December 31,
2017, in line with the decrease in our revenue generated from the provision of consulting and
research services in 2017.

Gross profit

Our gross profit decreased by 75.0% from approximately RMB2.8 million for the year
ended December 31, 2016 to approximately RMB0.7 million for the year ended December 31,
2017. Our gross profit margin decreased from 73.8% for the year ended December 31, 2016 to
61.1% for the year ended December 31, 2017, mainly because our revenue decreased at a faster
rate compared with our cost of sales as a result of an increase in our staff costs in 2017.

Other Income

Our other income increased by 218.9% from approximately RMB16.4 million for the year
ended December 31, 2016 to approximately RMB52.3 million for the year ended December 31,
2017, mainly due to the increase in our income from collaboration agreements as a result of
the technology consulting and technology transfer services we provided to a third party, which
were of non-recurring nature.

Other gains and losses

We recorded other gains of approximately RMB15.1 million for the year ended December
31, 2016, while we recorded other losses of approximately RMB24.6 million for the year ended
December 31, 2017, mainly due to the decrease in net gains from fair value changes of other
financial assets measured at FVTPL (unrealised) driven by the loss from contracts we entered
