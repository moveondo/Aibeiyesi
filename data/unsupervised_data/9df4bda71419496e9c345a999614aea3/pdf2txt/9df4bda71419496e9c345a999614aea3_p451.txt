DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND DISPOSAL OF A SUBSIDIARY

In April 2018, the shareholder of Beijing Junke Jingde Biotechnology Co., Ltd. resolved to dispose of the
segment of sales of biological reagent. The Group entered into a sales and purchase agreement with an independent
third party to dispose of its entire interest in Xinjingke for a cash consideration of RMB2,000,000. The disposal was
completed on June 29, 2018, on which date control of Xinjingke was passed to the acquirer. The reason for the
disposal was that the Group can concentrate its resources on development and documentation of drugs.

The (loss) profit for the year/period from the discontinued operations is set out below.
