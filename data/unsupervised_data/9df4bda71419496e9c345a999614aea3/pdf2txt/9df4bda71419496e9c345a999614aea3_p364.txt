STRUCTURE OF THE GLOBAL OFFERING

of certain bids or purchases made for the purpose of preventing or curbing a decline in the
market price of the Offer Shares while the Global Offering is in progress. Any market
purchases of our H Shares will be effected on any stock exchange,
including the Stock
Exchange, any over-the-counter market or otherwise, provided that
they are made in
compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulatory requirements. However, there is no
obligation on the Stabilizing Manager or any person acting for it
to conduct any such
stabilizing action. Such stabilizing activity, which if commenced, will be done at the absolute
discretion of the Stabilizing Manager and may be discontinued at any time.

Any such stabilizing activity is required to be brought to an end within 30 days of the last
day for the lodging of applications under the Hong Kong Public Offering. The number of Offer
Shares that may be over-allocated will not exceed the number of H Shares that may be sold
under the Over-allotment Option, namely, 23,836,500 Offer Shares, which is 15% of the
number of Offer Shares initially available under
the Global Offering, and cover such
over-allocations by exercising the Over-allotment Option or by making purchases in the
secondary market at prices that do not exceed the Offer Price or through stock borrowing
arrangements or a combination of these means.

In Hong Kong, stabilizing activities must be carried out in accordance with the Securities
and Futures (Price Stabilizing) Rules. Stabilizing actions permitted pursuant to the Securities
and Futures (Price Stabilizing) Rules (Chapter 571W of the Laws of Hong Kong) under the
SFO include:

(a)

(b)

(c)

(d)

(e)

market price of our H Shares;

selling or agreeing to sell the H Shares so as to establish a short position in them for
the purpose of preventing or minimizing any reduction in the market price of the H
Shares;

purchasing or subscribing for, or agreeing to purchase or subscribe for, our H Shares
pursuant to the Over-allotment Option in order to close out any position established
under (a) or (b) above;

purchasing, or agreeing to purchase, any of the H Shares for the sole purpose of
preventing or minimizing any reduction in the market price of the H Shares;

selling or agreeing to sell any of our H Shares in order to liquidate any position held
as a result of those purchases; and

(f)

offering or attempting to do anything as described in (b), (c), (d) or (e) above.

Stabilizing actions by the Stabilizing Manager, or any person acting for it, will be entered
into in accordance with the laws, rules and regulations in place in Hong Kong on stabilization.
