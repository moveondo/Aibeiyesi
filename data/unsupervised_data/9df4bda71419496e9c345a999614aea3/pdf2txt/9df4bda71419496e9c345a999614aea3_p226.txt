JS101 (CDK inhibitor)

JS101 is a chemical drug that inhibits the function of cyclin-dependent kinases (“CDKs”).
CDK inhibitors are used to treat cancers by preventing over-proliferation of cancer cells. We
developed JS101 and received IND approval from the NMPA in October 2018. We have also
applied for a patent regarding JS101. We plan to formulate our strategy for next steps of JS101
based on the progress of clinical trials.

Preclinical-stage Drug Candidates

As of the Latest Practicable Date, we had a pipeline of eight drug candidates at preclinical
tumor,

including, among others,

stage for the treatment of a wide range of indications,
psoriasis, multiple sclerosis, osteoporosis and migraine.
