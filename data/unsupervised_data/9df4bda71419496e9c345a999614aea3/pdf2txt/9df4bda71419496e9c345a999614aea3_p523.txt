APPENDIX III

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL LEGAL AND
REGULATORY PROVISIONS

The Mandatory Provisions require that a company must, in addition to preparing financial
statements according to the PRC Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, have its financial
statements prepared and audited in accordance with international or Hong Kong accounting
standards. The Company shall publish financial reports twice every accounting year, namely an
interim financial report within 90 days after the end of the first six months of the accounting
year and an annual financial report within 120 days after the end of the accounting year. The
Special Regulations require that there should not be any inconsistency between the information
disclosed within and outside the PRC and that, to the extent that there are differences in the
information disclosed in accordance with the relevant PRC and overseas laws, regulations and
requirements of the relevant stock exchanges, such differences should also be disclosed
simultaneously.

Information on Directors and Shareholders

The PRC Company Law gives shareholders the right to inspect the company’s articles of
association, minutes of the general meetings and financial and accounting reports. Under the
articles of association, shareholders have the right to inspect and copy (at reasonable charges)
certain information on shareholders and on directors which is similar to the rights of
shareholders of Hong Kong companies under the Companies Ordinance.

Corporate reorganization

Corporate reorganization involving a company incorporated in Hong Kong may be
effected in a number of ways, such as a transfer of the whole or part of the business or property
of the company in the course of being wound up voluntarily to another company pursuant to
section 237 of the Companies (Winding Up and Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance or a
compromise or arrangement between the company and its creditors or between the company
and its members pursuant to section 673 of the Companies Ordinance which requires the
sanction of the court. Under PRC laws, the merger or demerger of a joint stock limited liability
company shall be approved by voting by two-thirds of shareholders attending the general
meeting in person or by proxy, and also shall be approved by the relevant government
authorities (where applicable).

Remedies of a Company

Under the PRC Company Law, if a director, supervisor or manager in carrying out his
duties infringes any law, administrative regulation or the articles of association of a company,
which results in damage to the company, that director, supervisor or manager should be
responsible to the company for such damages. In addition, the Listing Rules require listed
companies’ articles to provide for remedies of the company similar to those available under
Hong Kong law (including rescission of the relevant contract and recovery of profits from a
director, supervisor or senior management).
