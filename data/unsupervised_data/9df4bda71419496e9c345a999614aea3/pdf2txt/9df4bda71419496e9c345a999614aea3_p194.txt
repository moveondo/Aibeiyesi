Investigators participating in our clinical studies are mainly clinicians independent from
us, who work in reputable hospitals across various provinces in China. The members of the
independent review committees include medical professionals from hospitals, medical centers
and universities, who are also independent from us.

Among our clinical studies on JS001,

those for advanced or metastatic urothelial
carcinoma (Phase II), refractory or etastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma (Phase II) and advanced
melanoma (Phase II, pivotal) are all single-arm, non-randomized trials with registration
purpose. The independent review committee-evaluated ORRs will be the primary endpoints to
support our NDA filings according to the Guidance for Industry Clinical Trial Endpoints for the
Approval of Cancer Drugs and Biologics and RECIST 1.1 (Response Evaluation Criteria In
Solid Tumours). Therefore, we have consulted independent review committees in these clinical
trials. By contrast, the clinical trial for metastatic mucosal melanoma (Phase Ib, + Axitinib) is
an exploratory clinical
