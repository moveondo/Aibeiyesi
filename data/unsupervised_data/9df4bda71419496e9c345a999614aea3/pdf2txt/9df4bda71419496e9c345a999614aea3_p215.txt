After the subcutaneous injection of the test drug, or Humira as a reference, to rats at the
same dose, the changes in blood concentration and pharmacokinetic behavior of both are
similar and comparable. Compared with Humira as a control, the relative bioavailability of the
test drug is 108.89% during a period of 42 days (1,008 hours) as shown in the chart above,
meaning UBP1211 has achieved slightly higher blood concentration compared with Humira.

Study on the protection on arthritis of hTNF-␣ transgenic mice

The results demonstrated that the recombinant human anti-TNF-␣ monoclonal antibody
can effectively prevent or treat the spontaneous arthritis of hTNF transgenic rata. The 3 mg/kg
treatment group showed significant protective effects, the incidence rate decreased to 67%, the
incidence score and histochemical score were significantly lower than the negative control
group, with significant statistically meaning; the 0.3 mg treatment group also showed certain
protective effects, but the histochemical score was not statistically significant as compared to
the negative control group. The results of effect of recombinant human anti-TNF-␣ monoclonal
antibody on the severe arthritis in hTNF-␣transgenic mouse set out in the graphic.
