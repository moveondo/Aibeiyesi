FINANCIAL INFORMATION

Our prepayments mainly comprise upfront fee paid for research and development services
for the clinical and non-clinical studies of our drug candidates. Prepayments also include other
prepaid operating expenses and prepayments for construction in progress and property, plant
and equipment. Our prepayments increased from approximately RMB173.0 million as at
December 31, 2016 to approximately RMB233.4 million as at December 31, 2017, primarily
due to an increase in prepayments for construction in progress, acquisition of property, plant
and equipment and upfront fee paid for research and development services for the clinical and
non-clinical research study of our drug candidates in line with our research and development
progress. Our prepayments increased to approximately RMB281.2 million as at June 30, 2018,
mainly due to increases in our demand for clinical and non-clinical study of our drug
candidates in line with our research and development progress.

Our deposits for leasehold interest in land decreased significantly from approximately
RMB13.6 million as at December 31, 2016 to approximately RMB5.4 million as at December
31, 2017 and remained stable at approximately RMB5.4 million as at June 30, 2018, primarily
due to the partial refund of the deposit we paid to the Lingang government for acquiring the
land use right to construct our Lingang Production Base.

Other Financial Assets

Our other financial assets mainly comprise financial products and funds. We recorded
other financial assets of approximately RMB373.5 million, RMB147.4 million and RMB84.2
million as at December 31, 2016 and 2017 and June 30, 2018, respectively. The decrease of our
other financial assets from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017 and from December 31,
2017 to June 30, 2018 reflected the redemption of our financial products during the period, to

products with licensed financial institutions and recorded financial products of approximately

and June 30, 2018. Most of our financial products have contractual terms from 7 days to 2
months, and the principals of most of our financial products are not guaranteed by the relevant
financial institutions and the expected return ranges from 1.78% to 1.82% and 2.74% to 3.13%
per annum for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2017 and 3.75% for the six months
