Each of our Company, Mr. Xiong Jun and Mr. Xiong Fengxiang has agreed to jointly and
severally indemnify the Sole Sponsor, the Joint Global Coordinators, the Joint Bookrunners,
the Joint Lead Managers, the Hong Kong Underwriters for certain losses which they may
suffer, including losses arising from their performance of their obligations under the Hong
Kong Underwriting Agreement and any breach by our Company of
the Hong Kong
Underwriting Agreement.

Commission and Expenses

According to the Hong Kong Underwriting Agreement, our Company will pay the Lead
Global Coordinators (on behalf of the Hong Kong Underwriters and the Joint Bookrunners) an
underwriting commission of 2% of the aggregate Offer Price in respect of all of the Hong Kong
Offer Shares (excluding any Hong Kong Offer Shares reallocated to and from the Hong Kong
Public Offering pursuant to the Hong Kong Underwriting Agreement). For unsubscribed Hong
Kong Offer Shares reallocated to the International Placing, if any, our Company will pay an
underwriting commission at
the rate applicable to the International Placing and such
commission will be paid to the relevant International Underwriters (but not the Hong Kong
Underwriters). Our Company may at our sole and absolute discretion elect to pay to the Joint
Global Coordinators for their respective accounts an incentive fee up to 1% of the Offer Price
for each Hong Kong Offer Share.

Assuming the Over-allotment Option is not exercised, the aggregate commissions and
fees, together with Stock Exchange listing fees, SFC transaction levy and Stock Exchange
trading fee, legal and other professional fees and printing and other expenses relating to the
Global Offering, which are currently estimated to amount
in aggregate to approximately
HK$138.07 million (assuming an Offer Price of HK$19.88 per Offer Share, being the
mid-point of our Offering Price range of HK$19.38 to HK$20.38), are payable and borne by
our Company.

We have agreed to indemnify the Hong Kong Underwriters for certain losses which they
may suffer, including losses arising from their performance of their obligations under the Hong
Kong Underwriting Agreement and breach by us of the Hong Kong Underwriting Agreement.
