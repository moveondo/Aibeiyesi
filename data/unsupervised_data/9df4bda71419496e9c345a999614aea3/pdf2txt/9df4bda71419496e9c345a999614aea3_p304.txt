Revenue

For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2017 and the six months ended June 30,
2018, we had not commercialized any drugs and therefore did not record any revenue from
drug product sales. During the Track Record Period, we derived our revenue from consulting
and research services income through fee-for-service contracts, pursuant to which we provided
specific project-related consultancy services related to technology, personnel and production
process and equipment for the development of drug candidates, among others, as well as
pharmaceutical research services. We recognized revenue of approximately RMB3.8 million,
RMB1.1 million, RMB1.1 million and nil for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2017 and
the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2018, respectively.

We are targeting to commercially launch JS001 in 2019 after receiving NDA approval
from the NMPA. In addition, we plan to file an NDA for UBP1211 to the NMPA in the first
half of 2019 and launch the drug in 2020 if the NDA approval is obtained. We expect the sales
of JS001 and UBP1211 to be the main source of our revenue for the next few years.

Our revenue decreased from approximately RMB3.8 million in 2016 to approximately
RMB1.1 million in 2017, mainly because (i) we provided less consulting and research services
to our customers in 2017 which were one-off contract based service; and (ii) there was a greater
focus on clinical research study of our drug candidates in 2017. Our revenue decreased from
RMB1.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017 to nil for the six months ended June
30, 2018, mainly because we did not engage in any such business during the period.

Cost of Sales

During the Track Record Period, our cost of sales primarily consisted of costs related to
the provision of consulting and research services. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and
2017 and the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2018, our overall cost of sales was
approximately RMB1.0 million, RMB0.4 million, RMB0.4 million and nil, respectively. Our
cost of sales decreased in terms of actual amount from 2016 to 2017 in line with the decrease
in our revenue generated from the provision of consulting and research services in 2017. Our
cost of sales decreased from RMB0.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017 to nil for
the six months ended June 30, 2018, mainly because we did not engage in any such business
during the period.

Upon the commercialization of our drug candidates such as JS001 and UBP1211, our

costs of sales will mainly relate to the sales of drug products.

Other Income

Other income includes government grants, income from business of non-recurring nature
under consulting and collaboration agreements and interest
income from bank and time
deposits. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2017 and the six months ended June 30,
2017 and 2018, we had other income of approximately RMB16.4 million, RMB52.3 million,
RMB1.8 million and RMB2.6 million, respectively.
