Advanced or Refractory Alveolar Soft Part Sarcoma (Phase I)

Design. In the Phase I clinical trial in advanced or refractory alveolar soft part sarcoma
treated with JS001, from October 2016 to June 2017, a total of 12 patients with advanced or
refractory alveolar soft tissue sarcoma received a JS001 infusion every two weeks, and were
evaluated for clinical efficacy by investigators at least once every six weeks in accordance with
the RECIST v1.1 assessment criteria.

Results. Of the 12 patients, one (8.3%) CR, two (16.7%) PR, and five (41.7%) SD were

confirmed with the ORR of 25.0% (3/12) and the DCR of 66.7% (8/12).

The following spider plot shows the changes in tumor burden over time of alveolar soft

part sarcoma patients treated with JS001 in Phase I clinical trial.

As shown in the image below, lung nidus nearly completely disappeared four weeks after

one of the patients received a single dose of 3 mg/kg of JS001.
