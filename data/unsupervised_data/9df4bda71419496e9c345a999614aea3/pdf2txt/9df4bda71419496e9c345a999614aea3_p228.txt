Our R&D Process

The following diagram illustrates the key milestones in the research, development and

commercialization of new drugs in the PRC:

 

PRECLINICAL STAGE

Discovery

Preclinical research

CMC

•  Identifying targets 
 
•  Obtaining drug 

candidates through 
hybridoma 
screening and 
humanization

•  Evaluating function of 
drug candidates in vitro 
and in vivo 

•  Testing pharmacokinetics 

and safety of the drug 
candidates and collecting 
information on dosing 
and toxicity levels in 
preparation for clinical 
trials

•  Developing the high-expression 

stable cell line, upstream 
fermentation process, downstream 
purification and formulation 
strategy

•  Characterizing drug candidates, 

defining critical quality attributes 
and performing stability study 
•  Manufacturing of clinical trial 

samples

IND: Application for approval of clinical trials

CLINICAL STAGE

Phase I clinical trial

Phase II clinical trial

 

Phase III clinical trial

Preliminary pharmacology and 
human safety trial

Preliminary assessment on 
efficacy

Confirmation of efficacy and
safety

NDA: Application for approval to manufacture and launch product

 

APPROVAL: Marketing authorization granted and commencement of commercial production

 

Our R&D Platforms

We have established an integrated technology system covering the entire process of
protein drugs from the early R&D stage to industrialization, which comprises seven key
technology platforms: (1) the automated high-efficiency screening platform for antibody
selection and functional assays, (2) human transmembrane receptor array and high-throughput
screening platform, (3) antibody humanization and construction platform, (4) high-yielding
stable expression cell lines screening and establishment platform, (5) CHO cell fermentation
process development platform, (6) antibody purification process development and formulation
optimization platform and (7) antibody quality research, control and assurance platform.
