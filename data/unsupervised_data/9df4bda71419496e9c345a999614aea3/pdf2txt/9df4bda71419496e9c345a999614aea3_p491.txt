Notes:

(a)

A slight increase in the expected volatility used in isolation would result in a slight increase in the fair
value measurement of convertible loan notes, and vice versa. If the volatility was 5% higher/lower to
47%/37% while holding all other variables constant, the carrying amount of the convertible loan notes
would increase by RMB7,153,000 or decrease by RMB3,947,000 as at September 30, 2018.

(b)

A slight increase in the discount rate used in isolation would result in a slight decrease in the fair value
measurement of convertible loan notes, and vice versa. If the discount rate was 0.5% higher/lower to
20.5%/19.5% while all other variables constant, the carrying amount of the convertible loan notes would
decrease by RMB1,634,000 or increase by RMB1,652,000 as at September 30, 2018.
