Cooperation with Betta

In May 2018, we entered into a combination therapy clinical study cooperation agreement
(the “Betta Agreement”) with Betta Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd. (“Betta”) to jointly develop a
combination therapy of our JS001 and Betta’s CM082 (vorolanib) for the treatment of
previously untreated local progression or metastatic mucosal melanoma. In July 2018, such
combination therapy’s IND has been accepted by the NMPA for review.

Clinical Trial. Betta will conduct the combination therapy clinical trial in mainland
China on toripalimab and vorolanib for the treatment of mucosal melanoma. We are
entitled to review the design, plan and reports of the clinical trial and will provide
toripalimab and other assistance where necessary.

IP. All data of the clinical trial belongs to Betta. We are entitled to use such data
including for the purpose of application for commercialization. If Betta obtains the
patent for the combination therapy, such patent shall be jointly owned by Betta and
us and both parties are entitled to implement such patent free of charge.

Exclusivity. Betta will only develop and commercialize CM-082 combination
therapy in mainland China with JS001 for the treatment of muscosal melanoma.

The Betta Agreement does not have a definitive term and does not provide for any

arrangement outside of the PRC or any payment or profit sharing arrangement.

agreement (the “CSPC Agreement”) with CSPC Pharmaceutical Group Limited (“CSPC”) in
