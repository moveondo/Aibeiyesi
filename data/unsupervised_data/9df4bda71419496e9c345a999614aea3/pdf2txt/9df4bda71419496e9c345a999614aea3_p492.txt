Fair value gains or losses on convertible loan notes designated at FVTPL of approximately RMB13,988,000
are included in ‘other gains and losses’, in which approximately RMB12,041,000 was capitalised in construction-
in-progress during the nine months ended September 30, 2018.

(iii) Fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities that are not measured at fair value on a recurring

basis

The fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities is determined in accordance with generally accepted

pricing models based on discounted cash flow analysis.

The directors of the Company consider that the carrying amount of financial assets and liabilities of the Group
in the Historical Financial Information approximate their fair value based on the

recorded at amortised cost
discounted cash flows analysis.

(iv)

Fair value measurement and valuation process

In estimating the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Group uses market-observable data to the extent it is
available. Where Level 1 inputs are not available, the Group engages third party qualified valuers to perform the
valuation or uses quoted forward exchange rates derived from quoted exchange rates matching maturities of the
contracts at the end of the reporting period. The finance department of the Company works closely with the qualified
external valuers to establish the appropriate valuation techniques and inputs to the model.

Information about the valuation techniques and inputs used in determining the fair value of various assets and

liabilities are disclosed above.
