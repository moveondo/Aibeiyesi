Loss for the period for the purpose of

operations

From discontinued operations

Basic earnings (loss) per share for the discontinued operations is RMB0.01 cent per share (unaudited)
for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 (nine months ended September 30, 2017: basic loss per share
of RMB0.04 cent (unaudited)), based on the profit for the period from the discontinued operations of
RMB89,000 (unaudited) for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 (nine months ended September 30,
2017: loss of RMB229,000 (unaudited)), and the denominators detailed above for the basic loss per share from
continuing and discontinued operations.

Basic loss per share for the discontinued operations is nil per share (unaudited) for the three months
ended September 30, 2018 (three months ended September 30, 2017: basic loss per share of RMB0.04 cent
(unaudited)), based on the loss for the period from the discontinued operations of nil (unaudited) for the three
months ended September 30, 2018 (three months ended September 30, 2017:
loss of RMB207,000
(unaudited)), and the denominators detailed above for
the basic loss per share from continuing and
discontinued operations.

(b)

Diluted

The Group issued the convertible loan notes on February 23, 2018 as set out in Note 18. For the purpose of
calculation of diluted loss per share, it did not assume the conversion of the convertible loan notes since their
assumed conversion would result in a decrease in loss per share.

The Group granted share options on May 14, 2018 as set out in Note 20. The computation of diluted loss per
share for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 did not assume the exercise of the Company’s outstanding share
options since their assumed exercise would result in a decrease in loss per share.

The Company does not have any dilutive potential ordinary shares outstanding during the nine months ended
September 30, 2017 and thus no diluted loss per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 are presented.
