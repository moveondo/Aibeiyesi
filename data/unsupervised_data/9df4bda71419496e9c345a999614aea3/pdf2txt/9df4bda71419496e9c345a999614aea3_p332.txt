FINANCIAL INFORMATION

Our current ratio decreased significantly from 28.7 as at December 31, 2016 to 8.7 as at
December 31, 2017, and further decreased to 4.9 as at June 30, 2018, mainly as a result of the
significant increase in our trade and other payables which is as a result of increased payables
to raw material suppliers, clinical research service providers, construction service providers
and equipment suppliers, increased salary and bonus payables as a result of an increased
number of employees as well as the increase in notes payables. Our quick ratio decreased
significantly during the same periods, primarily due to the same reasons stated above.
