7. Metastatic Mucosal Melanoma (Phase Ib, +Axitinib)

The clinical results of JS001 in the treatment of advanced melanoma registration show
that there is room for improvement in the response of mucosal melanoma subtype to PD-1
antibody monotherapy. One of the poor indicators of the prognosis of mucosal melanoma is the
formation of microvessels within the tumor and an increase in the number of microvessels is
associated with a shortened survival. The combination of an anti-angiogenic tyrosine kinase
inhibitor (TKI) and a PD-1 inhibitor has initially shown superiority over single agents in the
field of advanced kidney carcinoma and such result was published in Lancet Oncology in 2018.

Design. We conducted a Phase Ib clinical trial of JS001 combined with axitinib in the
treatment of metastatic mucosal melanoma from April 2017 to April 2018. A total of 33 patients
with mucosal melanoma were enrolled, including esophagus, nasopharynx, rectal and vaginal
melanoma. As of May 20, 2018, all 33 patients had received at least one efficacy evaluation.

Results. Of the 33 patients evaluated, 20 patients achieved PR and 9 achieved SD, with
the ORR of 60.6% and the DCR of 87.9%. Since 16 of the 20 patients continued to have
response, the mDOR had not yet been reached. The following waterfall plot shows the optimal
tumor shrinkage rate in mucosal melanoma patients after the combined therapy.
