Goodwill was arisen from the Group’s acquisition of Beijing Xinjingke Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (“Xinjingke”)
in 2016, whose principal activity is trading of biological product and equipment. For the purpose of impairment
testing, goodwill has been allocated to one cash-generating unit. During the Track Record Period, management of the
Group determines that there is no impairment to the cash-generating unit containing goodwill. The recoverable
amount of the cash-generating unit has been determined based on a value in use calculation. That calculation uses
cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a 5-year period, and pre-tax
discount rate of 20% at December 31, 2016 and 2017. The cash flows beyond the 5-year period are extrapolated at
a steady growth rate of 3% at December 31, 2016 and 2017. The management believes such growth rate does not
exceed the average long-term growth rate for the relevant industry. Other key assumptions for the value in use
calculation relate to the estimation of cash inflows/outflows, which include budgeted revenue, such estimation is
based on its past performance and management’s expectation for the market development. The management
determines that any reasonably possible change in any of these assumptions would not cause the carrying amount of
the cash-generating unit containing such goodwill exceeds its recoverable amount.
