(b)

Government grants include subsidies from the PRC government which are specifically for (i) the capital
expenditure incurred for plant and machinery, which is recognised as income over the useful life of the
related assets; (ii) the incentive and other subsidies for research and development activities and (iii)
other subsidies for listing on NEEQ, which are recognised upon meeting the attached conditions.

On February 28, 2017, the Group entered into an agreement with Jiangsu T-mab Biopharma Co., Ltd (江
蘇泰康生物醫藥有限公司) (“T-mab”), pursuant to which the Group provided T-mab with know-how and
consulting services to build up a certificate of Good Manufacturing Practice (“cGMP”) compliant
facility. All performance obligations were completed in 2017 and therefore the Group recognised
RMB10,849,000 as service income in 2017.

On August 28, 2017, the Group and T-mab entered into a co-development and commercialisation
agreement (the “Collaboration Agreement”) for UBP1211, a biosimilar the Group originally had sole
ownership of patents and know-how. Under the terms of the Collaboration Agreement, the patents and
know-how from the research and development of UBP1211 will be registered under the name of both
parties while all future research and development costs and net profit from sales of UBP1211 upon
successful commercialisation will be evenly shared between the Group and T-mab. The Group has joint
control over the arrangement that unanimous consent is required from all parties to the agreement for
relevant activities including clinical studies, manufacturing and marketing. As such,
the Group
accounted for the arrangement as joint operation. A non-refundable consideration of RMB36,571,000
received upon the signing of the Collaboration Agreement from T-mab on passing T-mab the right to
access the know-how of UBP1211 was recognised in other income.

As part of the Collaboration Agreement, T-mab also granted the Group a loan commitment of
RMB60,000,000 at the benchmark borrowing rate of the People’s Bank of China plus 30% premium with
expiration date of August 27, 2019. As at June 30, 2018, RMB20,000,000 of the loan commitment was
utilised by the Group as set out in Note 26.
