Wujiang Production Base

Wujiang Production Base is located in Wujiang Economic and Industrial Development
Zone, Suzhou City, Jiangsu Province. It occupies a site area of approximately 9,610 sq.m. with
a total gross floor area of approximately 12,384 sq.m. The construction of our Wujiang
Production Base has been completed, and we have obtained the drug production license for our
Wujiang Production Base on 14 February 2017.

Wujiang Production Base comprises storage areas, a quality control laboratory capable of
conducting biochemical testing, physical and chemical testing and microbiological testing,
utilities including water, HVAC and gas systems, and production areas including one drug
substance workshop with 1,500L bioreactors, one drug substance workshop with 400L
bioreactors, one fill/finish workshop for vials and one fill/finish workshop for prefilled
syringes. We anticipate that Wujiang Production Base will serve as one of our major
commercial manufacturing bases.
