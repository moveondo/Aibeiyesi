We have confirmed through Lys-C peptide mapping that the amino acid sequence of
UBP1211 is identical to that of the reference product Humira, which is required for the
biosimilar pathway under NMPA regulations. The graph below shows the peptide fingerprint
of UBP1211 compared with Humira. UBP1211 and Humira were fragmented by endoproteinase
Lys-C degradation and the peptides were separated by liquid chromatography-mass
spectroscopy/mass spectroscopy (LC-MS/MS). This technology creates a peptide fragment-
based fingerprint for proteins. If the fingerprints are identical, it can be inferred that two
proteins have identical amino acid primary structure.
