INDUSTRY OVERVIEW

Potential market size of PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors in the PRC

The PRC PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors market is still at an early stage of development but has
strong growth potentials. PD-1/PD-L1 products are expected to cover different indications in
clinical therapies. The proportion of addressable patients for PD-1/PD-L1 drugs in China in
2017 was around 81.5%. The addressable patients are calculated based on the targeted patients
who have been recruited for the Phase III clinical trial or trials that have been used for NDA
submission in China, and the patients who have been approved to be treated globally as of June
2018. The market size of PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors together is estimated to grow to RMB37.4
billion in 2022, representing a CAGR of 534.4% from 2018 to 2022, and further increase to
RMB98.4 billion in 2030, representing a CAGR of 12.8% from 2022 to 2030.

Key assumptions include (i) PD-1 inhibitors from the Company, Hengrui, BeiGene and Innovent will be
launched in 2019 based on their respective timing of submission, past approval durations for MNC PD-1
inhibitors and assuming no significant difference between PD-1 inhibitor approval durations for MNCs
and local pharmaceutical companies; (ii) the annual treatment cost of local pharmaceutical companies
in China will be 70% of MNC brands based on statistics of historical biologics pricing differences
between MNC and local brands; (iii) In 2019, both MNC and local PD-1 inhibitors will be added to the
NRDL. MNC PD-1 inhibitor annual treatment cost will decrease by 40% upon its addition to the NRDL
and further decrease by 3% in each subsequent year , while local PD-1 inhibitor annual treatment cost
will decrease by 35% upon its addition to the NRDL and further decrease by 2% in each subsequent year
based on statistics of historical pricing trends of biologics upon and after addition to the NRDL. By
2030, there will be no significant difference in annual treatment cost between MNC and local PD-1
inhibitors; and (iv) Combination therapies will be a major growth driver for the China PD-1/PD-L1
antibody market based on the latest published research results global wide.

The estimates have not taken into account off-label prescriptions.

There is no significant difference in the treatment rates for patients with different indications. The
treatment rate is projected on the basis of total addressable patients. In clinical practice, the same drug
product (for instance, JS001, upon requisite approvals) could be prescribed for different types of cancer
patients and, therefore, the expected market size for PD-1 inhibitors and PD-L1 inhibitors cannot be
reliably or meaningfully broken down by indications.

The main driver for local anti-PD-1/PD-L1 products to capture the market share is price advantage. It
is estimated that the price gap between MNC and local anti-PD-1/PD-L1 products is around RMB90,000
before anti-PD-1/PD-L1 products are included in the reimbursement drug list, and the gap is estimated
