encourage clinically oriented drug innovation, under which innovative drugs should
have definite clinical value and modified drugs should present obvious clinical
advantages over the drugs being modified;

broaden the definition of applicants for marketing authorization from “domestic
institutions” to “domestic entities” to cover both the drug research and development
institutions and the scientific researchers;

on-site inspections and sample taking are not compulsory prerequisites for NMPA
approval, and the NMPA may determine whether to take such steps based on the
results of regulatory review of drug registration applications;

clinical trials can be conducted in the sequence of Phase I, II and III, or in flexible
manners based on the characteristics and applicability of drugs and existing
information;

the NMPA should establish a priority review system and the applicants can apply for
the priority rights for those drugs eligible for the conditions;

Although there is no definitive timeline for the official enactment of the revised Measures
for the Administration of Drug Registration, it embodies a regulatory trend of promoting drug
innovation, accelerating the drug registration process and setting forth higher quality and
technical requirements.
