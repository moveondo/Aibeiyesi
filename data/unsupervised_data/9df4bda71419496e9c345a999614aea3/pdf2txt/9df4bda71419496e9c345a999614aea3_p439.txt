Note: Amounts represent

trade receivables from Beijing Zhengdan International Technology Co., Ltd
(“BJZD”) and United-Power Pharma Tech Co., Ltd. (“UPPT”). BJZD is a non-controlling shareholder
of Beijing Junke Jingde Biotechnology Co., Ltd. while UPPT is an associate of BJZD.

The balance of trade receivables as at January 1, 2016 is nil.

The average credit period on sales of goods is 30 days. No interest is charged on outstanding trade receivables.

The Group always measures the loss allowance for trade receivables at an amount equal to lifetime ECL.

There has been no change in the estimation techniques or significant assumptions made during the Track

Record Period.

The Group writes off a trade receivable when there is information indicating that the debtor is in severe
financial difficulty and there is no realistic prospect of recovery, e.g. when the debtor has been placed under
liquidation or has entered into bankruptcy proceedings, or when the trade receivables are over two years past due,
whichever occurs earlier. None of the trade receivables that have been written off is subject to enforcement activities.

The aged analysis of the Group’s trade receivables, based on invoice date at the end of each reporting period

are as follows:

0 - 30 days
30 - 90 days
90 - 180 days
180 days - 1 year
1 - 2 years
