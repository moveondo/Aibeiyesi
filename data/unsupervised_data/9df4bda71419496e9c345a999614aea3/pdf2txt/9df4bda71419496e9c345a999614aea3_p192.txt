Strong internalization induction

Upon binding with its specific antigen PD-1 receptor, JS001 blocks the interaction of
PD-1 and its ligand and simultaneously induces the internalization of PD-1 receptor and
decreases the expression of PD-1 on the cell membrane surface. Immunofluorescence assay
results below show that JS001 induced strong internalization induction.

JS001-induced PD-1 internalization was directly visualized by microscopy using 293T.hPD1 cells. 293T.hPD1
cells were incubated at 37°C with 0.3 µg/mL of CypHer5E-labeled JS001. Upon internalization, the endosomes
containing the labeled antibody are acidified, rendering CypHer5E fluorescent and visualized. Shown are
pictures of an individual cell taken at 30 min and 6 hours. By 6 hours, punctate fluorescence and the
accumulation of fluorescent vesicles (dots or small circles of fluorescence) can clearly be visualized in the
large cytoplasmic region of the 293T.hPD1 cell.

The following graphs show a decrease in PD-1 expression on the cell surface during
internalization of JS001 by simultaneously staining the JS001 non-competitive anti-PD-1
monoclonal antibody (clone MIH4). A decrease in PD-1 expression can improve the reactivity
of T cells to the antigen. This mechanism does not rely on PD-1 ligand (PD-L1) expression.

Flow cytometry results show that JS001 induced internalization and

reduced the expression of PD-1 on the membrane surface concurrently
