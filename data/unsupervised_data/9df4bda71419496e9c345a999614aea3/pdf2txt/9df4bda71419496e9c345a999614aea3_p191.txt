An anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody is designed to prevent PD-1 from binding PD-L1/PD-

L2, which leads to a recovery of the function of the T cell.

• Antigen(Ag) is capable of stimulating 

an immune response. Antigen-
presenting cells (APCs) can bind to Ag
to activate T-cell receptor (TCR) and
major histocompatibility complex(MHC)
binding.

• Regulatory T cells create a highly

immunosuppressive tumor
environment by maintaining the
expression of PD-1 on its surface.

Features of JS001

High affinity

The following graph illustrate(s) the binding affinity of JS001 for PD-1 as measured by Biacore T200. Such
KD measure of the affinity of JS001 was approximately 0.3 nM. The result shows high binding affinity of JS001,
which enables it to bind more firmly to its specific antigen PD-1 receptor and to better compete against the binding
of PD-L1 and PD-L2 on tumor cells.

RU = resonance units. S = seconds. The slow dissociation rate (KD) means high affinity of JS001 to PD-1.
