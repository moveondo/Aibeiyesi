FINANCIAL INFORMATION

Our net current assets increased from approximately RMB452.4 million as at December
31, 2017 to approximately RMB495.7 million as at June 30, 2018 primarily driven by an
increase in other assets, prepayments and other receivables of approximately RMB61.8 million
and an increase in bank balances and cash of RMB125.6 million, partially offset by a decrease
in other financial assets of RMB63.3 million and an increase in trade and other payables of
RMB67.0 million.

Our net current assets decreased from approximately RMB495.7 million as at June 30,
2018 to net current liabilities of approximately RMB2.7 million as at November 30, 2018
primarily due to a decrease in bank balances and cash of RMB211.5 million which was mainly
used for our clinical trials, staff salary and welfare for research and development personnel and
the construction of our production facilities, a decrease in other financial assets of RMB78.7
million which mainly reflected our redemption of our financial products, an increase in trade
and other payables of RMB117.1 million and an increase in short-term borrowings of RMB92.1
million, both of which were mainly used to support our construction of production facilities.
