APPENDIX IA

CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Unless previously redeemed, converted or purchased and cancelled as provided herein, the Company will
redeem the convertible loan note at 100% of its principal amount, together with accrued but unpaid interest thereon.

The Group and the Company have designated the convertible loan notes as whole as financial liabilities
measured at FVTPL. The change in fair value of the convertible loan notes is charged to profit or loss except for the
portion attributable to credit risk change that shall be charged to other comprehensive income.

The movement of the convertible loan notes for the period is set out as below:

At February 23, 2018 (date of issuance)

The Company has used the binominal option pricing model to determine the fair value of the convertible loan

notes as of the dates of issuance and at the end of each reporting period.

Key valuation assumptions used to determine the fair value of convertible loan notes are as follows:

Share price
Discount rate
Time to maturity
Risk-free rate
Expected volatility (Note)
Expected dividend yield

comparable companies with similar business nature of the Company as of the valuation dates.
