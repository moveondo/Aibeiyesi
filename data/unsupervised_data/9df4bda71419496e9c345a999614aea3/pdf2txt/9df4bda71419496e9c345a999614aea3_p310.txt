Income Tax (Expense) Credit

For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2017 and the six months ended June 30,
2018, we recorded income tax expense of approximately RMB0.2 million and RMB58,000 and
income tax credit of approximately RMB70,000, respectively. We recorded loss before tax of
approximately RMB131.2 million, RMB320.7 million and RMB273.0 million, respectively.

The provision for PRC enterprise income tax is based on the statutory rate of 25% of the
assessable profits of PRC companies as determined in accordance with the EIT Law which
became effective on January 1, 2008. The EIT Law imposes a unified enterprise income tax rate
of 25% on all domestic and foreign invested enterprises unless they are qualified for
preferential tax treatments. Under the EIT Law and implementation regulations of the EIT Law,
the basic tax rate of the Company and its PRC subsidiaries is 25% during the Track Record
Period.

The United States federal imposed progressive corporate income tax rates ranging from
15% to 35%. The US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Act”) was enacted into law on December 22,
2017. The Act includes significant changes to the US corporate income tax system that have
become effective on January 1, 2018, including a reduction of the US corporate income tax rate
to a flat rate of 21%.

As of the Latest Practicable Date and during the Track Record Period, we fulfilled all our

tax obligations and were not aware of any outstanding or potential tax disputes.

Discontinued operations

the entire equity interest

On April 25, 2018, Beijing Junkejingde entered into a share transfer agreement with an
in Beijing Xinjingke
Independent Third Party to transfer
Biotechnology to an independent third party at a consideration of RMB2.0 million. Beijing
Xinjingke Biotechnology mainly engaged in the business of sales of biological reagents. As of
the Latest Practicable Date, we had disposed Beijing Xinjingke Biotechnology and ceased such
business as the sales of biological reagents was not our primary business and we intend to focus
on the research and development of drug candidates going forward. We believe that the
disposal of Beijing Xinjingke Biotechnology was in our interests and we currently have no
intention to re-enter into the business of sales of biological reagents. The assets and liabilities
of Beijing Xinjingke Biotechnology have been classified as a disposal entity held for sale and
the comparative figures
loss and other
comprehensive income have been presented separately to represent the business of Beijing
Xinjingke Biotechnology as discontinued operations as at June 30, 2018. For further details,
