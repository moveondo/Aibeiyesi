OUR HISTORY AND DEVELOPMENT

REASONS FOR THE LISTING ON THE STOCK EXCHANGE

Our Domestic Shares are currently listed on NEEQ. We are seeking a listing of our H

competitive strengths and raise capital for our business development, advance our international
strategies and further expand our capital structure. For further details, please refer to the
sections headed “Future Plans and Use of Proceeds” and “Business” in this prospectus.
