Outstanding Pre-IPO Options

As of the Latest Practicable Date, outstanding Pre-IPO Options for an aggregate of
5,798,000 Domestic Shares, representing (i) approximately 0.96% of the total number of
Domestic Shares in issue, (ii) approximately 0.76% of the total number of Shares immediately
following completion of the Global Offering (without taking into account any Shares which
may be issued upon the exercise of the Over-allotment Option, the 2018 Convertible Bonds and
the Pre-IPO Options) and (iii) approximately 0.76% of the total number of Shares immediately
following completion of the Global Offering assuming all the Pre-IPO Options are exercised
at the same time if our Company elects to issue new Shares in satisfaction of these Pre-IPO
Options (without taking into account any Shares which may be issued upon the exercise of the
Over-allotment Option and the 2018 Convertible Bonds), have been granted by our Company
under the Share Incentive Scheme for nil consideration per Grantee. Particulars of the Pre-IPO
Options are set out below.

Based on the total number of 760,310,000 Shares in issue immediately following
completion of the Global Offering (assuming the Over-allotment Option is not exercised and
without taking into account the 2018 Convertible Bonds and before exercise of the Pre-IPO
Options), if all the outstanding Pre-IPO Options for a total of 5,798,000 Shares are exercised
in full and our Company elects to issue new Domestic Shares to satisfy these Pre-IPO Options,
there would be a dilution effect of approximately 0.80% on the earnings per Share. There will
be no dilution effect on the earnings per Share if our Company elects to satisfy the Pre-IPO
Options by existing Shares.

Assuming that following the Global Offering (assuming the Over-allotment Option is not
exercised and without taking into account the 2018 Convertible Bonds) the registered capital
of our Company remains unchanged and our Company does not issue any new Share (other
than for the satisfaction of Pre-IPO Options) or securities or right to subscribe for Shares in the
four years ending December 31, 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021, and that none of the Grantees
cease to be eligible under the Share Incentive Scheme and Share Incentive Agreements, and the
terms of the Share Incentive Scheme and Share Incentive Agreements remain unchanged, in the
event that the Grantees exercise the Pre-IPO Options in full on each vesting date as set out in
the paragraph headed “2. Summary of terms of the Share Incentive Agreements” above and our
