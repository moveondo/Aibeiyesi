Our other losses decreased by 54.4% from approximately RMB10.6 million for the six
months ended June 30, 2017 to approximately RMB4.8 million for the six months ended June
30, 2018, mainly due to decrease in the loss on fair value changes of foreign exchange forward
contracts and increase in net gains from fair value changes of other financial assets measured
at FVTPL, partially offset by an increase in loss on fair value changes of convertible loan notes
measured at FVTPL.

Research and development expenses

research and development expenses increased by 86.8% from approximately
RMB116.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017 to approximately RMB217.8 million
for the six months ended June 30, 2018, mainly due to our increased clinical trial expenses,

We did not incur finance costs for the six months ended June 30, 2017 while we recorded
finance cost of approximately RMB2.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018,
consisting of interest expense on short-term borrowings as a result of transaction costs for the

the reasons described above, our
