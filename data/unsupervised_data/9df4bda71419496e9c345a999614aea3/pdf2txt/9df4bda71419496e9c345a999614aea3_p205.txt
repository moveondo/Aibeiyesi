Advanced Melanoma (Phase II, pivotal)

Design. Patients who have failed systemic treatment received a 3 mg/kg JS001 infusion
every two weeks and were evaluated for clinical efficacy every eight weeks by the independent
review committee in accordance with the RECIST v1.1 assessment criteria. This trial recruited
128 advanced melanoma patients who had failed systemic treatment from December 2016 to
September 2017. All patients had at least six months’ follow-up. As of the latest data cut-off
date, 121 patients had received at least one efficacy evaluation.

Results. Among the 121 evaluable patients, 1 CR, 24 PR and 48 SD were observed with
the ORR of 20.7% (25/121) and the DCR of 60.3% (73/128). Our ORR would be reduced from
20.7% (25/121) to 17.2% (22/128) if we divide the aggregate of CR and PR cases (without
counting three of PR cases doubted by PI) by the number of all patients (instead of evaluable
patients). As of the latest date for data collection, 20 patients with objective response were still
having ongoing responses and therefore the mDOR had not been reached.

As shown in the following figure, among the four subtypes of melanoma, chronic sun
damage (CSD) and non-chronic sun damage (non-CSD) are the main types in America (94%),
while Acral and Mucosal are the major melanoma types (73%) in China, reflecting the
epidemiological differences between ethnic groups in different regions. The accumulation of
DNA mutations caused by UV exposure is the main cause of the onset of CSD and Non-CSD
types. In comparison, Acral and Mucosal subtypes harbor limited DNA mutations and thus have
divergent underlying tumorigenesis mechanism. As shown in the clinical results above, CSD
(ORR 35.3%, DCR 64.7%) and Non-CSD (ORR 33.3%, DCR 77.8%) subtype patients had a
better response to PD-1 antibody monotherapy than the Acral (ORR 14.3%, DCR 53.1%) and
Mucosal (ORR 0%, DCR 42.1%) subtype patients.
