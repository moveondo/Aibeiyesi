BUSINESS

Opdivo, Keytruda and Libtayo are the only three marketed anti-PD-1 medications
worldwide, which have been approved by FDA for multiple oncological indications that JS001
is also intended for. Opdivo and Keytruda have been approved for sales in the PRC in June and
July 2018, respectively. We filed for NDA approval with the NMPA in March 2018, being the
first PRC company to file NDA with the NMPA for an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody. Three
other pharmaceutical companies have filed NDAs for their anti-PD-1 products to the NMPA
following us. In addition, there were 15 PD-1 and nine PD-L1 monotherapy clinical trials in
Phase III and 27 combination therapy clinical trials in Phase III for PD-1/PD-L1 in China as
of the Latest Practicable Date. While we may face competition from Opdivo, Keytruda, PRC
companies and other MNCs engaged in the commercialization of anti-PD-1 monoclonal
antibodies, we believe we are able to maintain our competitiveness with our rapid clinical
progress, corroborant efficacy and stable production process.
