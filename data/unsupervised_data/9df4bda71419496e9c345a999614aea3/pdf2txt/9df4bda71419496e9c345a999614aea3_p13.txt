Notes:

(1) We have completed Phase II clinical trial for melanoma 2L, based on which we filed NDA with
the NMPA. We expect to obtain such NDA approval in late 2018 or early 2019 and are preparing
to launch JS001 in the PRC shortly after obtaining NDA approval. We were undertaking Phase
III clinical trial for melanoma 1L as of the Latest Practicable Date.

(2) We plan to initiate Phase III clinical trials of JS001 for nasopharyngeal carcinoma, gastric
carcinoma, esophageal carcinoma and non-small cell lung carcinoma in the first quarter of 2019.
For indications other than the above-mentioned indications and melanoma, we will determine the
timing of the initiation of the next phase of clinical trials based on various considerations
including the progress and outcome of the current phase of clinical trials, industry development
and competition.

(3)

In accordance with the biosimilar approval pathway in China, we were undertaking Phase I and
Phase III clinical trials of UBP1211 concurrently as of the Latest Practicable Date.
