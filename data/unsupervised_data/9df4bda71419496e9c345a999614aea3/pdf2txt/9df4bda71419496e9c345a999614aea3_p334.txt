FINANCIAL INFORMATION

(2) For other receivables mainly composed of rental deposits due from landlords and
deposits for leasehold interest in land due from a local government, we assessed the
possibilities of default remained unchanged throughout the Track Record Period.

The credit risk on our liquid funds is limited because the counterparties are banks, asset
ratings assigned by

management companies and securities companies with high credit
international credit-rating agencies.

Liquidity Risk

In the management of the liquidity risk, we monitor and maintain a level of cash and cash
equivalents as well as undrawn banking facilities deemed adequate by our directors to finance
our operations and mitigate the effects of fluctuations in cash flows.

We relied on borrowings, convertible loan notes and the issuance of ordinary shares as a
significant source of liquidity. For further details, please refer to Notes 26, 27 and 30 to the
Accountants’ Report in Appendix I to this prospectus.

The following table details our remaining contractual maturity for our non-derivative
financial liabilities. The table has been drawn up based on the undiscounted cash flows of
financial liabilities based on the earliest date on which we can be required to pay. The table
includes both interest and principal cash flows. To the extent that interest flows are floating
rate, the undiscounted amounts are derived from interest rates at the end of December 31, 2016
and 2017 and June 30, 2018, respectively.

In addition, the following table details our liquidity analysis for our derivative financial
instruments. The tables have been drawn up based on the undiscounted gross (inflows) and
outflows on those derivatives that require gross settlement. The liquidity analysis for our
derivative financial
instruments are prepared based on the contractual maturities as the
management considers that the contractual maturities are essential for an understanding of the
timing of the cash flows of derivatives.
