Advanced Gastric Adenocarcinoma (Phase Ib/II)

Design. Patients received a 3 mg/kg JS001 infusion every two weeks and were evaluated
by investigators for clinical efficacy every eight weeks in accordance with the RECIST v1.1
assessment criteria. 58 advanced gastric adenocarcinoma patients were enrolled into the study.
As of December 30, 2017, 43 patients underwent at least one efficacy evaluation.

Results. Of the 43 patients evaluated, 8 patients had PR and 9 patients had SD with the
ORR of 18.6% (8/43) and the DCR of 39.5% (17/43). Efficacy in PD-L1 positive gastric
adenocarcinoma patients was better than in negative patients. The PR of 6 PD-L1 positive
tumor patients and 36 PD-L1 negative tumor patients were 50.0% (3/6) and 13.9% (5/36),
respectively.
