RECORD PERIOD

Merger by absorption of Shanghai Union Biopharm

Shanghai Union Biopharm was a limited liability company established in the PRC on July
28, 2008. Immediately before the completion of the merger with our Company in June 2016,
Shanghai Union Biopharm had a registered capital of RMB146,071,040 and had 48
shareholders. It was previously listed on the NEEQ (stock code: 430598.NEEQ). Shanghai
Union Biopharm was mainly engaged in the business of R&D of drugs.

In order to effectively consolidate research resources, reduce competition, create synergy
and develop a better platform for the research of drugs, our Company and Shanghai Union
Biopharm entered into a merger by absorption agreement on May 30, 2015, a first supplemental
agreement on July 10, 2015 and a second supplemental agreement on September 1, 2015
pursuant to which parties agreed to merge by absorption of Shanghai Union Biopharm. The
merger would be carried out by the issue of 0.050317983 Shares in our Company in exchange
of 1 share in Shanghai Union Biopharm each. An aggregate of 7,350,000 Shares with a nominal
value of RMB1.00 each, representing approximately 33.33% of our enlarged share capital at
the relevant time, would be issued to all the then shareholders of Shanghai Union Biopharm,
after which our registered capital was increased from RMB14.7 million to RMB22.05 million
as a result. The consideration was determined with reference to the net asset per share in
Shanghai Union Biopharm. After the exchange of shares, all assets and liabilities, businesses,
employees, contracts and all other rights and liabilities of Shanghai Union Biopharm would be
succeeded by our Company. Shanghai Union Biopharm subsequently applied for cancellation
and delisting from NEEQ. As of the Latest Practicable Date, the deregistration of Shanghai
Union Biopharm with the relevant
local office of the Administration for Industry and
Commerce has been completed.
