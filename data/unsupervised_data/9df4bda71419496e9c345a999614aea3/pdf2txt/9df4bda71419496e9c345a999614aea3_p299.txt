Clinical trial progress and commercialization of our drug candidates. For the years
ended December 31, 2016 and 2017 and the six months ended June 30, 2018, we
incurred losses of approximately RMB132.0 million, RMB321.1 million and
RMB272.8 million, respectively, as we had not commercialized any drugs or
generated any revenue from the sales of drug products. Among our drug candidates,
JS001 has completed the pivotal clinical trial for malignant melanoma and as of the
Latest Practicable Date, it was being reviewed by the NMPA for NDA approval;
UBP1211 is close to complete patient enrollment for Phase III clinical trial in the
near future; JS002 is under Phase I clinical trial; UBP1213 is expected to commence
patient enrollment for Phase I clinical trial in 2019 and JS003 is preparing for
clinical
IND approval. We are targeting to
commercially launch and begin to generate revenue from JS001 and UBP1211 in
2019 and 2020, respectively. We expect the sales of JS001 and UBP1211 to be the
main source of our revenue for the next few years. We believe our robust and diverse
pipeline of drug candidates in several fast-growing therapeutic areas will be the
driving force for our long-term competitiveness, as well as our future growth and
profitability.

Research and development expenses. We believe that research and development is
critically important to the sustainable growth of our business and we have devoted
significant resources and focus on the research and development of our drug
candidates. Our research and development expenses increased significantly by
125.7% from approximately RMB122.0 million for the year ended December 31,
2016 to approximately RMB275.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017,
and increased by 86.8% from approximately RMB116.6 million for the six months
ended June 30, 2017 to approximately RMB217.8 million for the six months ended
June 30, 2018, primarily due to increases in the clinical trial expenses and the
number of our research and development staff. We expect to continue to increase our
research and development
and
commercialization plan.

Potential competition upon commercialization of our drug candidates and product
price. We may face competition from a number of domestic and international
companies developing, manufacturing and selling biologics of the same or similar
types as our drug candidates, and we expect competition to intensify as new players
enter the market. In such an environment, competitive pricing may be an important
factor affecting our results of operations, while changes in pricing strategies by our
competitors may have an adverse impact on our results of operations.

Cost Structure. During the Track Record Period, a substantial part of our costs of our
continuing operations were in relation to research and development and office
administration. We expect our cost structure to evolve as we develop and expand our
business. As we commercially launch JS001, UBP1211 and other drugs, we
to incur additional costs in relation to our raw materials procurement,
