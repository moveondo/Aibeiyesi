We also rely on trade secrets, proprietary know-how and continuing technological
innovation to develop and maintain a competitive position for our products. We generally
impose obligations on our key management and key technical staff to keep our trade secrets
confidential. In general, relevant agreements we entered into with our key management and key
technical staff provide that all of the technology which is conceived by the individual during
