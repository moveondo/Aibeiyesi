APPENDIX I

ACCOUNTANTS’ REPORT

In particular, the following information is taken into account when assessing whether credit risk has increased

significantly since initial recognition:

(cid:129)

(cid:129)

(cid:129)

(cid:129)

(cid:129)

(cid:129)

an actual or expected significant deterioration in the financial instrument’s external (if available) or
internal credit rating;

significant deterioration in external market indicators of credit risk for a particular financial instrument,
e.g. a significant increase in the credit spread, the credit default swap prices for the debtor, or the length
of time or the extent to which the fair value of a financial asset has been less than its amortised cost;

existing or forecast adverse changes in business, financial or economic conditions that are expected to
cause a significant decrease in the debtor‘s ability to meet its debt obligations;

an actual or expected significant deterioration in the operating results of the debtor;

significant increases in credit risk on other financial instruments of the same debtor; and

an actual or expected significant adverse change in the regulatory, economic, or technological
environment of the debtor that results in a significant decrease in the debtor’s ability to meet its debt
obligations.

Irrespective of the outcome of the above assessment, the Group presumes that the credit risk on a financial
asset has increased significantly since initial recognition when contractual payments are more than 30 days past due,
unless the Group has reasonable and supportable information that demonstrates otherwise.

Despite the aforegoing, the Group assumes that the credit risk on a financial instrument has not increased
significantly since initial recognition if the financial instrument is determined to have low credit risk at the reporting
date. A financial instrument is determined to have low credit risk if i) the financial instrument has a low risk of
default, ii) the borrower has a strong capacity to meet its contractual cash flow obligations in the near term and iii)
adverse changes in economic and business conditions in the longer term may, but will not necessarily, reduce the
ability of the borrower to fulfil its contractual cash flow obligations. The Group considers a financial asset to have
low credit risk when it has an internal or external credit rating of ‘investment grade’ as per globally understood
definition.

The Group regularly monitors the effectiveness of the criteria used to identify whether there has been a
significant increase in credit risk and revises them as appropriate to ensure that the criteria are capable of identifying
significant increase in credit risk before the amount becomes past due.

Definition of default

The Group considers the following as constituting an event of default for internal credit risk management
purposes as historical experience indicates that receivables that meet either of the following criteria are generally not
recoverable.

(cid:129)

(cid:129)

when there is a breach of financial covenants by the counterparty; or

information developed internally or obtained from external sources indicates that the debtor is unlikely
to pay its creditors, including the Group, in full (without taking into account any collaterals held by the
Group).

Irrespective of the above analysis, the Group considers that default has occurred when a financial asset is more
than 90 days past due unless the Group has reasonable and supportable information to demonstrate that a more
lagging default criterion is more appropriate.

Credit-impaired financial assets

Financial asset is credit-impaired when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated
future cash flows of that financial asset have occurred. Evidence that a financial asset is credit-impaired includes
observable data about the following events:

(a)

significant financial difficulty of the issuer or the borrower;
