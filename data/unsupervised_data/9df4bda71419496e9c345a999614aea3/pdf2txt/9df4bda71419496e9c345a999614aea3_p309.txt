FINANCIAL INFORMATION

For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2017 and the six months ended June 30,
2018, we incurred research and development expenses in the amount of approximately
RMB122.0 million, RMB275.3 million and RMB217.8 million, respectively. The significant
increases in our research and development expenses were mainly due to (i) increases in clinical
trial expenses and preclinical study costs, as we initiated a number of preclinical research and
clinical trials for several new indications and accelerated the progress of clinical trials; (ii)
increases in our staff salary and welfare for research and development personnel, which was
primarily due to the increase in the number of our research and development personnel from
94 as at December 31, 2016 to 101 as at December 31, 2017 and further to 111 as at June 30,
2018; and (iii) increases in depreciation and amortization expenses, which was attributable to
the commencement of operation of our Wujiang Production Base.

For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2017 and the six months ended June 30, 2017
and 2018, our administrative expenses were approximately RMB42.8 million, RMB73.8
million, RMB30.5 million and RMB49.8 million, respectively. The significant increases in our
administrative expenses were mainly due to (i) increases in our administrative staff costs,
which was primarily attributable to the increase in the number of our administrative personnel;
(ii) increases in our depreciation and amortization, which was related to the property and
equipment in our Wujiang Production Base; and (iii) increases in our office administration
expenses, primarily because we increased general office expenses in line with the growth in our
business scale as well as in the number of our administrative personnel, and as a result of the
commencement of operation of our Wujiang Production Base.
