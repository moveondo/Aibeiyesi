Notes:

(a)

The cost of the investments are reviewed at the end of each reporting period to determine whether
there is any indication that those investments have suffered an impairment loss (if any). Recoverable
amount is the higher of fair value less cost to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use,
management needs to estimate the future cash flows expected from the cash-generating units and an
appropriate discount rate in order to calculate the present value of the future cash flows.

(b)

Certain managements and employees who work at group’s subsidiaries are granted share options
under the Scheme of the Company. The Company therefore recorded the grant as deemed contribution
to the subsidiaries in the Company’s financial statements.
