WAIVERS FROM STRICT COMPLIANCE WITH THE LISTING RULES AND

EXEMPTIONS FROM STRICT COMPLIANCE WITH THE COMPANIES

(WINDING UP AND MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS) ORDINANCE

In preparation of the Global Offering, we have sought

the following waivers and
exemptions from strict compliance with the relevant provisions of the Listing Rules and the
Companies (Winding Up and Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance:

WAIVER IN RELATION TO NON-EXEMPT CONTINUING CONNECTED
TRANSACTION

The non-exempt continuing connected transaction described under the section headed
“Connected Transactions” in this prospectus are expected to continue on a recurring basis after
the Listing and have been entered into prior to the Listing Date. Given details of such
transactions have been disclosed in this prospectus and potential investors will participate in
the Global Offering on the basis of such disclosure, hence our Directors consider that strict
compliance with the announcement requirement would be unduly burdensome, and would add
unnecessary administrative costs upon us.

Accordingly, our Company has applied for, and the Stock Exchange has granted to our
Company, a waiver from strict compliance with the announcement requirement under Rule
14A.105 of the Listing Rules in respect of the non-exempt continuing connected transaction.
The waiver granted by the Stock Exchange will expire on December 31, 2020. Upon expiry of
the waiver, such non-exempt continuing connected transaction will be subject to the then
applicable Listing Rules. Further information including the annual caps, basis and conditions
of the waiver is set forth in the section headed “Connected Transaction” in this prospectus.

WAIVER IN RELATION TO JOINT COMPANY SECRETARIES

Pursuant to Rules 3.28 and 8.17 of the Listing Rules, our company secretary must be an
individual who by virtue of his academic or professional qualifications or relevant experience
is, in the opinion of the Stock Exchange, capable of discharging the functions of company
secretary. The Stock Exchange considers the following academic or professional qualifications
to be acceptable:
