If you have applied as a CCASS Investor Participant, you can also check the number
of Hong Kong Offer Shares allotted to you and the amount of refund monies (if any)
payable to you via the CCASS Phone System and the CCASS Internet System (under
the procedures contained in HKSCC’s “An Operating Guide for
Investor
Participants” in effect
from time to time) on Friday, December 21, 2018.
Immediately following the credit of the Hong Kong Offer Shares to your stock
account and the credit of refund monies to your bank account, HKSCC will also
make available to you an activity statement showing the number of Hong Kong
Offer Shares credited to your CCASS Investor Participant stock account and the
amount of refund monies (if any) credited to your designated bank account.

Refund of your application monies (if any) in respect of wholly and partially
unsuccessful applications and/or difference between the Offer Price and the
maximum Offer Price per Offer Share initially paid on application (including
brokerage, SFC transaction levy and the Stock Exchange trading fee but without
interest) will be credited to your designated bank account or the designated bank
account of your broker or custodian on Friday, December 21, 2018.

15. ADMISSION OF THE H SHARES INTO CCASS

If the Stock Exchange grants the listing of, and permission to deal in, the H Shares and
we comply with the stock admission requirements of HKSCC, the H Shares will be accepted
as eligible securities by HKSCC for deposit, clearance and settlement in CCASS with effect
from the date of commencement of dealings in the H Shares or any other date HKSCC chooses.
Settlement of transactions between Exchange Participants (as defined in the Listing Rules) is
required to take place in CCASS on the second business day after any trading day.

All activities under CCASS are subject to the General Rules of CCASS and CCASS

Operational Procedures in effect from time to time.

Investors should seek the advice of their stockbroker or other professional adviser for
details of the settlement arrangement as such arrangements may affect their rights and interests.

All necessary arrangements have been made enabling the H Shares to be admitted into

CCASS.
