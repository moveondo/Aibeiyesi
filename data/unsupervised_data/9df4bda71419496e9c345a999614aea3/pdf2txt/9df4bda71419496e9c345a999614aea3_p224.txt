Market Opportunity and Competition

Belimumab, developed by GSK, received FDA approval in 2011 for the indication of
active SLE. It was the first approved specific treatment for SLE in more than 50 years. In 2017,
global anti-BLyS antibody market reached USD0.5 billion and is expected to grow to USD2.9
billion in 2022 and USD8.8 billion in 2030, respectively. As of the Latest Practicable Date,
GSK had finished Phase III clinical trial of belimumab in China, which is expected to receive
NDA approval in 2019. Other than belimumab, there were no other anti-BLyS fully human or
humanized monoclonal antibodies in or beyond phase II clinical trials in China as of the Latest
Practicable Date. Our preclinical study indicated that UBP1213 can compete with belimumab
for the binding epitope of BLyS and shows a slower dissociation rate and higher affinity
compared with belimumab. With a large patient population, excellent clinical results, an
improving medical insurance system in China and the lack of effective treatment regime, the
market of anti-BLyS antibody in China is forecast to grow to RMB10.2 billion in 2030.

Globally, there is currently only one anti-BLyS mAb in the market while another five,
namely (i) TACI-lg (APRIL, BAFF/BLyS) by ZymoGenetics, Inc. and Merck Serono, (ii)
Atacicept (BAFF/BLyS) by Anthera Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Zenyaku Kogyo Co., Ltd., (iii)
MEDI-0700 (ICOS ligand, BAFF/BLyS) by MedImmune, LLC, (iv) Blisibimod (ICOS ligand,
BAFF/BLyS) by AstraZeneca PLC and Amgen, Inc. and (v) BAFF/IL-17 bispecific antibody
(IL17, BAFF/BLys) by Eli Lilly and Company are in various stages of clinical trials. In China,
there are no BLyS mAbs approved while one is in Phase III clinical trial and our UBP1213 is
in Phase I clinical trial.
