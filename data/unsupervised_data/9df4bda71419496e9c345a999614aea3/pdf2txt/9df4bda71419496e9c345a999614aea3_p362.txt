STRUCTURE OF THE GLOBAL OFFERING

Allocation

Pursuant

to the International Placing,

the International Placing Shares will be
conditionally placed on behalf of our Company by the International Underwriters or through
selling agents appointed by them. The International Placing will include selective marketing of
Offer Shares to certain professional and institutional investors and other investors anticipated
to have a sizeable demand for such Offer Shares in Hong Kong and other jurisdictions outside
the United States in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S and in the United States
to QIBs as defined in Rule 144A. The International Placing is subject to the Hong Kong Public
Offering being unconditional.

Allocation of Offer Shares pursuant to the International Placing will be effected in
accordance with the “book-building” process described in the paragraph headed “– Pricing and
Allocation” in this section and based on a number of factors, including the level and timing of
demand, total size of the relevant investor’s invested assets or equity assets in the relevant
sector and whether or not it is expected that the relevant investor is likely to buy further, and/or
hold or sell, Offer Shares, after the listing of our Offer Shares on the Stock Exchange. Such
allocation is intended to result in a distribution of the Offer Shares on a basis which would lead
to the establishment of a solid Shareholder base to the benefit of our Company and our
Shareholders as a whole.

The Lead Global Coordinator (for itself and on behalf of the Underwriters) may require
any investor who has been offered Offer Shares under the International Placing and who has
made an application under the Hong Kong Public Offering, to provide sufficient information
to the Lead Global Coordinator so as to allow it to identify the relevant applications under the
Hong Kong Public Offering and to ensure that they are excluded from any application of Offer
Shares under the Hong Kong Public Offering.

Reallocation

The total number of Offer Shares to be issued or sold pursuant to the International Placing
may change as a result of the clawback arrangement described in the paragraph headed “– The
Hong Kong Public Offering – Allocation” in this section, the exercise of the Over-allotment
Option in whole or in part described in the paragraph headed “– Over-allotment Option” in this
section, and any reallocation of unsubscribed Offer Shares originally included in the Hong
Kong Public Offering and/or any Offer Shares from the International Placing to the Hong Kong
Public Offering at the discretion of the Lead Global Coordinator.
