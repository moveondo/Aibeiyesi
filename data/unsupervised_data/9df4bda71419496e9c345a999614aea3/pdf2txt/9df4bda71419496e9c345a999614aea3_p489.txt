Notes:

(a)

(b)

The share price is determined based on the share price on February 23, 2018, which is the date of
shareholders’ approval of newly issued shares on March 7, 2018.

The expected volatility was determined by using the historical volatility of the share price of the
comparable companies with similar business nature of the Company as of the valuation dates.

The Black-Scholes option pricing model has been used to estimate the fair value of the options. The variables
and assumptions used in computing the fair value of the share options are based on the directors’ best estimate.
Changes in variables and assumptions may result in changes in the fair value of the options.
