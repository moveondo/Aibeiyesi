FINANCIAL INFORMATION

For the year ended December 31, 2017, we had net cash used in operating activities of
approximately RMB347.1 million, primarily due to operating loss before movements in
working capital of approximately RMB319.5 million and the negative effect of the movements
in working capital. The negative movements in working capital mainly include: (i) an increase
in trade and other receivables of approximately RMB36.7 million due to increased value added
tax recoverable and increased prepayments consisting of upfront fee paid for research and
development services for the clinical and non-clinical study of our drug candidates; and (ii) an
increase in inventories of approximately RMB23.5 million due to the increased purchase of raw
materials and consumables for clinical research purposes. These cash outflow were partially
offset by an increase in trade and other payables of approximately RMB17.6 million and an
increase in deferred income of approximately RMB14.9 million, due to increased government
grants.
