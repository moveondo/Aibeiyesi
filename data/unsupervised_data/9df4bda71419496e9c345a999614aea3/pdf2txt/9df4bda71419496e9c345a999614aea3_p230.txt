Our R&D Centers

We have set up three R&D centers worldwide, among which our San Francisco Lab and
Maryland Lab primarily focus on the research of mechanisms on known and innovative targets
in tumor and autoimmune diseases field, early detection of drugs and precise screening of drug
molecules. The domestic Suzhou R&D center mainly conducts functional verification and
process development of drugs.

We have established a globally integrated R&D process. We are among the first PRC
companies to set up labs in the U.S. Our San Francisco Lab carries out preliminary high
throughput antibody screening and further humanization, selection and optimization. Our
Maryland Lab utilizes a membrane receptor protein array and a eukaryotic cell-based
functional assay platform to carry out the screening of new targets and the evaluation and
selection of antibody candidates. We have used our integrated R&D system only for the
development of innovative monoclonal antibody drugs, while our remaining drug candidates,
namely UBP1211 and UBP1213, were jointly developed by third parties and us outside our
integrated R&D system. As we do not plan to develop additional biosimilar drugs in the
foreseeable future, we expect to continue to use our integrated R&D system only for the
development of innovative monoclonal antibody drugs.

With the support our Maryland Lab and San Francisco Lab, our Suzhou and Shanghai
production bases in China are responsible for the establishment of stable cell lines, processes
optimization, GMP-standard production, establishment and maintenance of global quality
systems, production of drugs to be used in clinical
trials and the future commercial
manufacturing. While our labs in the U.S. closely follow the latest technology trends in the
biotech innovative drugs R&D, our PRC labs carry out follow-up supporting work in the R&D
process in order to optimize our R&D with higher efficiency and lower costs.
