FINANCIAL INFORMATION

During the Track Record Period, our bank interest income decreased by approximately
RMB0.4 million from RMB2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to RMB2.3
million for the year ended December 31, 2017, and increased by approximately RMB0.1
million from RMB1.5 million for the six months period ended June 30, 2017 to RMB1.6
million for the same period in 2018. The decrease in bank interest income from the year ended
December 31, 2016 to the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily attributable to the
lower average cash account balance in such period as a result of our increasing capital needs
for our research and development, clinical trials as well as the construction of our production
bases. The increase in bank interest income from the six months ended June 30, 2017 to the six
months ended June 30, 2018 was primarily attributable to the increase in our overseas bank
interest income as a result of our higher average U.S. dollar cash account balance in such
period.

During the Track Record Period, we received certain government grants to invest in our
research and development activities for various reasons such as encouragement of innovation
and research and development, awarding companies in the strategic emerging industries and
supporting high-level technology talents. Government grants include subsidies from the PRC
government for (i) the capital expenditure incurred for plant and machinery; (ii) the incentive
and other subsidies for research and development activities; and (iii) other subsidies for listing
on NEEQ, which are recognized upon meeting with certain conditions attached to the grants
received. As there is a risk that government grants previously received by us may be forfeited
if we fail to satisfy the conditions, we generally do not recognize such grants in profit or loss
until the relevant projects have been completed and the conditions attached to the grants have
been fulfilled.

During the Track Record Period, we occasionally engaged in business of non-recurring
nature by entering into collaboration agreements and providing technology consulting services.
Our other income increased significantly from approximately RMB16.4 million in 2016 to
approximately RMB52.3 million in 2017, mainly because we recorded a one-off payment of
approximately RMB47.4 million from collaboration agreements in 2017 consisting of (i)
approximately RMB36.6 million received from the co-development and commercialization
agreement we entered into with T-mab; and (ii) approximately RMB10.8 million from the
know-how and consulting services we provided to T-mab. Our other income increased from
approximately RMB1.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017 to approximately
RMB2.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018, primarily because we recognized
more government grants in profit for the six months ended June 30, 2018 compared with the
six months ended June 30, 2017 as a result of our compliance with the conditions attached to
the grants received.
