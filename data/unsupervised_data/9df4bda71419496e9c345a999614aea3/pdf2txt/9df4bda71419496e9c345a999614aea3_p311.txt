Revenue

During the Track Record Period, we derived revenue from the sales of reagents through
Beijing Xinjingke Biotechnology. We recognized revenue in our discontinued operations of
approximately RMB2.2 million, RMB5.9 million, RMB4.0 million and RMB2.0 million in
2016, 2017 and the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2018, respectively.

Cost of sales

During the Track Record Period, our cost of sales primarily consisted of costs related to
procurement of reagents. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2017 and the six months
ended June 30, 2017 and 2018, our overall cost of sales was approximately RMB1.9 million,
RMB4.7 million, RMB3.4 million and RMB1.7 million, respectively. Our cost of sales
increased in terms of actual amount from 2016 to 2017 in line with the growth in our revenue
generated from the sales of reagents during the same period. Our cost of sales decreased from
RMB3.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017 to RMB1.7 million for the six months
ended June 30, 2018 in line with the decreased revenue derived from the sales of reagents
during the same period.
