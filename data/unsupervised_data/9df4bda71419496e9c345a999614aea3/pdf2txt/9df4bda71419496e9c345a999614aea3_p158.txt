Pediatric Information

Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, BLAs or supplements must contain data
adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all
relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric
subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FFDCA requires that a sponsor
who is planning to submit a marketing application for a product that includes a new active
ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of
administration submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan, or PSP, within 60 days of an end-of-Phase
2 meeting or as may be agreed between the sponsor and the FDA. The initial PSP must include
an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including study
objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification
for not
including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric
assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies
along with supporting information. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the
applicant, grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. The FDA and the
sponsor must
reach agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an
agreed-upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based
on data collected from preclinical studies, early phase clinical trials, and/or other clinical
development programs.
