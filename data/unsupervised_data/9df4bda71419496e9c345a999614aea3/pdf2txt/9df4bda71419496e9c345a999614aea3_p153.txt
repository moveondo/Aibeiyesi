U.S. Biological Products Development Process

The process required by the FDA before a biological product may be marketed in the

United States generally involves the following:

completion of nonclinical laboratory tests and animal studies according to Good
Laboratory Practices, or GLPs, and applicable requirements for the humane use of
laboratory animals or other applicable regulations;

submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug Application, or IND, which
must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;

performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the
safety and efficacy of the proposed biological product for its intended use, according
to the FDA’s regulations, commonly referred to as good clinical practices, or GCPs,
and any additional requirements including those for the protection of human
research subjects and their health and other personal information;

submission to the FDA of a Biologics License Application, or BLA, for marketing
approval
includes substantive evidence of safety, purity and potency from
results of nonclinical testing and clinical trials;

that

satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or
facilities where the biological product is produced to assess compliance with current
Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, to assure that the facilities, methods and
controls are adequate to preserve the biological product’s identity, strength, quality
and purity;

potential FDA audits of the nonclinical study and clinical trial sites that generated
the data in support of the BLA; and

FDA review and approval of the BLA.

Preclinical Studies

Biological product development

in the United States typically involves preclinical
laboratory and animal
tests include laboratory evaluation of product
chemistry, formulation, and toxicity, as well as animal trials to assess the characteristics and
potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply
with federal regulations and requirements including GLPs, among other requirements. The
results of preclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other
