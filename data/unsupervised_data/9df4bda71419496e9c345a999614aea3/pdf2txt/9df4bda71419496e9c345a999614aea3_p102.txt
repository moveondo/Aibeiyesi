WAIVERS FROM STRICT COMPLIANCE WITH THE LISTING RULES AND

EXEMPTIONS FROM STRICT COMPLIANCE WITH THE COMPANIES

(WINDING UP AND MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS) ORDINANCE

(d) we have appointed Somerley Capital Limited as our compliance advisor

in
compliance with Rule 3A.19 of the Listing Rules to act as our additional channel of
communication with the Stock Exchange, and be available to answer inquiries from
the Stock Exchange. The compliance advisor will have reasonable access at all times
to our Company’s authorized representatives, the Directors and the other officers to
ensure that it is in a position to provide prompt responses to any inquiries or requests
from the Stock Exchange in respect of our Group.

WAIVER IN RELATION TO PUBLIC FLOAT

Rule 8.08(1)(a) of the Listing Rules requires that there must be an open market in the
securities for which listing is sought and that a sufficient public float of an issuer’s listed
securities shall be maintained. This normally means that at least 25% of the issuer’s total issued
share capital must at all times be held by the public. Rule 8.08(1)(b) of the Listing Rules states
that where an issuer has one class of securities or more apart from the class of securities for
which listing is sought, the total securities of the issuer held by the public (on all regulated
market(s) including the Stock Exchange) at the time of listing must be at least 25% of the
issuer’s total number of issued shares. However, the class of securities for which listing is
sought must not be less than 15% of the issuer’s total number of issued shares, having an
expected market capitalization at the time of listing of not less than HK$125,000,000. Pursuant
to Rule 8.08(1)(d) of the Listing Rules, the Stock Exchange may, subject to certain conditions
and at its discretion, accept a lower percentage of between 15% and 25% in the case of issuers
with an expected market capitalization at the time of listing of over HK$10 billion.

We have applied for, and the Stock Exchange has granted, a waiver from strict compliance
with Rule 8.08(1) of the Listing Rules that the minimum public float be reduced and the
minimum percentage of the H Shares from time to time held by the public to be the highest of:

(a)

16%;

(b)

(c)

such percentage of H Shares to be held by the public immediately after completion
of the Global Offering (assuming the Over-allotment Option is not exercised); or

such percentage of H Shares to be held by the public after the exercise of the
Over-allotment Option,

but the percentage of minimum public float so decided above shall be reduced as a result
of any increase in our Company’s issued share capital following any issue of Domestic
Shares by our Company upon exercise of any Pre-IPO Options and/or
the 2018
Convertible Bonds, provided that (i) the market capitalization of the portion of the total
number of our Company’s issued shares held by the public shall exceed HK$375 million
at the time of Listing pursuant to Rule 18A.07 of the Listing Rules and (ii) the minimum
percentage of public float from time to time shall not be lower than 15.71% of our
Company’s issued share capital.
