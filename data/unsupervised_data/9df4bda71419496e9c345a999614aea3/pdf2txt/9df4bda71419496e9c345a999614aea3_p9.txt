SUMMARY

UBP1211 is a biosimilar of Humira (adalimumab) used for the treatment of
autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. UBP1211 is one of the first
Humira biosimilars developed by a PRC company to receive IND approval from the
NMPA. As of the Latest Practicable Date, we had completed patient enrollment for
Phase III clinical trial of UBP1211. We plan to file NDA with the NMPA in the
second half of 2019.

JS002 is the first anti-PCSK9 monoclonal antibody developed by a PRC company
to obtain IND approval from the NMPA. Pre-clinical experimental data have shown
that JS002 has excellent activity in reducing low-density lipoprotein. As of the
Latest Practicable Date, JS002 was under Phase I clinical trial. We plan to complete
Phase I clinical
for primary
hypercholesterolemia and mixed dyslipidemia in December 2018.

trial and commence Phase II clinical

trial

UBP1213 is the first and only anti-BLyS monoclonal antibody developed by a PRC
company to obtain IND approval from the NMPA. UBP1213 has been developed for
the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus and other autoimmune diseases. We
plan to commence patient enrollment for Phase I clinical trial of UBP1213 in 2019.

JS003 is a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting PD-L1 protein. PD-L1 has
emerged as an important cancerbiomarker and a target for immunotherapy. As of the
Latest Practicable Date, we had received IND approval from the NMPA and were
preparing for the clinical trial of JS003.

In addition to our five clinical-stage biologic drug candidates, there are also eight other
biologic drug candidates currently under preclinical research. In 2016, 2017 and the six months
ended June 30, 2018, our R&D expenses amounted to RMB122.0 million, RMB275.3 million
and RMB217.8 million, respectively.
