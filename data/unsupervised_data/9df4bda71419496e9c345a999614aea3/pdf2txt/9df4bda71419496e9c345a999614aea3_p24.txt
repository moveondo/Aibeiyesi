SUMMARY

DIVIDENDS

factors,

including our

We have never declared or paid any dividends on our ordinary shares. We currently intend
to retain all available funds and earnings, if any, to fund the development and expansion of our
business and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Any
future determination to pay dividends will be made at the discretion of our Board and may be
based on a number of
future operations and earnings, capital
requirements and surplus, general financial condition, contractual restrictions and other factors
that our Board may deem relevant. The payment of any dividends will also be subject to the
PRC Law and our constitutional documents. As confirmed by our PRC Legal Advisor,
according to the PRC law, any future net profit that we make will have to be first applied to
make up for our historically accumulated losses, after which we will be obliged to allocate 10%
of our net profit to our statutory common reserve fund until such fund has reached more than
50% of our registered capital. We will therefore only be able to declare dividends after (i) all
our historically accumulated losses have been made up for; and (ii) we have allocated sufficient
net profit to our statutory common reserve fund as described above.

NO MATERIAL ADVERSE CHANGE

Our Directors have confirmed that, up to the date of this prospectus, there has been no
material adverse change in our financial, operational or trading position since June 30, 2018,
being the end of the period reported in the Accountants’ Report included in Appendix I to this
prospectus.
