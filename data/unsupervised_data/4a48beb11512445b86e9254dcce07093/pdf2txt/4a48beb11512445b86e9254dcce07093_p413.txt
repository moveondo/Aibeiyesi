STRUCTURE OF THE GLOBAL OFFERING

Specifically, prospective applicants for and investors in the Offer Shares should note that:

(a)

(b)

(c)

(d)

(e)

(f)

the Stabilization Manager (or any person acting for it) may, in connection with the
stabilizing action, maintain a long position in the Shares;

there is no certainty as to the extent to which and the time or period for which the
Stabilization Manager (or any person acting for it) will maintain such a long
position;

liquidation of any such long position by the Stabilization Manager (or any person
acting for it) and selling in the open market may have an adverse impact on the
market price of the Shares;

no stabilizing action can be taken to support the price of the Shares for longer than
the stabilization period, which will begin on the Listing Date, and is expected to
expire on Thursday, November 22, 2018, being the 30th day after the last day for
lodging applications under the Hong Kong Public Offering. After this date, when no
further stabilizing action may be taken, demand for the Shares, and therefore the
price of the Shares, could fall;

the price of the Shares cannot be assured to stay at or above the Offer Price by the
taking of any stabilizing action; and

stabilizing bids or transactions effected in the course of the stabilizing action may
be made at any price at or below the Offer Price and can, therefore, be done at a
price below the price paid by applicants for, or investors in, the Offer Shares.

The Company will ensure or procure that an announcement in compliance with the
Securities and Futures (Price Stabilizing) Rules of the SFO will be made within seven days of
the expiration of the stabilization period.

Over-Allocation

Following any over-allocation of Shares in connection with the Global Offering, the
Stabilization Manager (or any person acting for it) may cover such over-allocations, among
other methods, by exercising the Over-allotment Option in full or in part, by using Shares
purchased by the Stabilization Manager (or any person acting for it) in the secondary market
at prices that do not exceed the Offer Price or through stock borrowing arrangements or a
combination of these means.
