APPENDIX II

UNAUDITED PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION

Our firm applies Hong Kong Standard on Quality Control 1 “Quality Control for Firms
that Perform Audits and Reviews of Financial Statements, and Other Assurance and Related
Services Engagements” issued by the HKICPA and accordingly maintains a comprehensive
system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance
with ethical
requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory
requirements.

Reporting Accountants’ Responsibilities

Our responsibility is to express an opinion, as required by paragraph 4.29(7) of the
Listing Rules, on the unaudited pro forma financial information and to report our opinion to
you. We do not accept any responsibility for any reports previously given by us on any
financial information used in the compilation of the unaudited pro forma financial information
beyond that owed to those to whom those reports were addressed by us at the dates of their
issue.

We conducted our engagement in accordance with Hong Kong Standard on Assurance
Engagements 3420 “Assurance Engagements to Report on the Compilation of Pro Forma
Financial Information Included in a Prospectus” issued by the HKICPA. This standard requires
that the reporting accountants plan and perform procedures to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the Directors have compiled the unaudited pro forma financial information in
accordance with paragraph 4.29 of the Listing Rules and with reference to AG 7 issued by the
HKICPA.

For purposes of this engagement, we are not responsible for updating or reissuing any
reports or opinions on any historical financial information used in compiling the unaudited pro
forma financial information, nor have we, in the course of this engagement, performed an audit
or review of the financial information used in compiling the unaudited pro forma financial
information.

The purpose of unaudited pro forma financial information included in an investment
circular is solely to illustrate the impact of a significant event or transaction on unadjusted
financial information of the Group as if the event had occurred or the transaction had been
undertaken at an earlier date selected for purposes of the illustration. Accordingly, we do not
provide any assurance that the actual outcome of the event or transaction at 30 June 2018
would have been as presented.

A reasonable assurance engagement

to report on whether the unaudited pro forma
financial
information has been properly compiled on the basis of the applicable criteria
involves performing procedures to assess whether the applicable criteria used by the Directors
in the compilation of the unaudited pro forma financial information provide a reasonable basis
for presenting the significant effects directly attributable to the event or transaction, and to
obtain sufficient appropriate evidence about whether:

(cid:129)

the related pro forma adjustments give appropriate effect to those criteria; and
