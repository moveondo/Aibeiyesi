IBI306 produces a more durable decrease in LDL-C after a

single dose in monkeys than does evolocumab

Abbreviation: LDL-C = low-density lipoprotein cholesterol.

Clinical Development Plan

Our IND application for IBI-306 was approved by the NMPA in September 2017. We are
conducting a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-center Phase 1 clinical trial
in China to evaluate the safety,
tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and
immunogenicity of single ascending doses of IBI-306 in healthy adults. The ascending dose
design includes six dose level cohorts: 25 mg, 75 mg, 150 mg, 300 mg, 450 mg and 600 mg.
Tolerance and safety data for up to 14 days after dosing from all subjects of the previous cohort
will be reviewed before proceeding to the next dose. Total duration of the study per subject is
12 weeks. The first subject was enrolled in November 2017. If this trial is successful, we expect
to advance IBI-306 to Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials in China in 2019.

Licenses, Rights and Obligations

We have the rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize IBI-306 in China, Hong
Kong and Macau. We obtained the original DNA sequence for IBI-306 from Adimab pursuant
to our collaboration agreement with Adimab. See “-Collaboration Agreements-Collaboration
with Adimab” below for details of our rights and obligations with respect to IBI-306.
