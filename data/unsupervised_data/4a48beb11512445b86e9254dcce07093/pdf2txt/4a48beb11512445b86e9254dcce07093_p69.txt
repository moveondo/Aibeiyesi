RISK FACTORS

Furthermore, there can be no assurance that non-head-to-head analyses (e.g., comparisons with
competing drugs based on their publicly available study and trial data) will be predictive of
future clinical results. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology
industries have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials due to lack of efficacy
or adverse safety profiles, notwithstanding promising results in earlier trials. Our future
clinical trial results may not be favorable.

trials of our drug candidates fail

If clinical
to demonstrate safety and efficacy to the
satisfaction of regulatory authorities or do not otherwise produce positive results, we may
incur additional costs or experience delays in completing, or ultimately be unable to
complete, the development and commercialization of our drug candidates.

Before obtaining regulatory approval for the sale of our drug candidates, we must conduct
extensive clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our drug candidates in
humans. We may experience numerous unexpected events during, or as a result of, clinical
trials that could delay or prevent our ability to receive regulatory approval or commercialize
our drug candidates, including but not limited to:

regulators,

authorize us or our investigators to commence a clinical trial or conduct a clinical
trial at a prospective trial site;

our inability to reach agreements on acceptable terms with prospective CROs and
trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary
significantly among different CROs and trial sites;

including problems with manufacturing, supply quality,
manufacturing issues,
compliance with good manufacturing practice, or GMP, or obtaining from third
parties sufficient quantities of a drug candidate for use in a clinical trial;

clinical trials of our drug candidates may produce negative or inconclusive results,
and we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical trials
or abandon drug development programs;

the number of patients required for clinical trials of our drug candidates may be
larger than we anticipate, enrollment may be insufficient or slower than we
anticipate or patients may drop out at a higher rate than we anticipate;

our third-party contractors, including clinical investigators, may fail to comply with
regulatory requirements or meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely
manner, or at all;

we might have to suspend or terminate clinical trials of our drug candidates for
various reasons,
response or other
unexpected characteristics or a finding that participants are being exposed to
unacceptable health risks;

including a finding of a lack of clinical
