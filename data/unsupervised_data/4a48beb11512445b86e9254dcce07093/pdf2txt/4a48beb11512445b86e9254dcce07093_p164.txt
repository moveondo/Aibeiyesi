INDUSTRY OVERVIEW

PD-L1 Antibodies

Due to the relatively late launch of PD-L1 mAbs and limited approved indications, the
global sales revenue of PD-L1 mAbs was only USD537 million in 2017. According to the Frost
& Sullivan Report, the global sales revenue of PD-L1 mAbs is expected to grow in light of the
expansion of indications relating to PD-L1 mAbs. The diagram below summarizes the
approved indications of the three FDA-approved PD-L1 mAbs, as well as the global sales
revenue of PD-L1 mAbs from 2016 to 2017.

In 2017, the total global sales revenue of the five PD-1 and PD-L1 antibodies approved
by FDA (PD-1 inhibitors Keytruda and Opdivo and PD-L1 inhibitors Tecentriq, Bavencio and
Imfinzi) was US$10.1 billion, with a CAGR of 412.2% from 2014 to 2017. Due to the
expansion of new cancer indications and launch of combo therapies, the sales revenue of PD-1
and PD-L1 antibodies is expected to continue to rise in the next ten years, amounting to
US$78.9 billion in 2030. The diagram below summarizes the global PD-1 and PD-L1 antibody
market size from 2014 to 2017 and the estimated global PD-1 and PD-L1 antibody market size
from 2018 to 2030.
