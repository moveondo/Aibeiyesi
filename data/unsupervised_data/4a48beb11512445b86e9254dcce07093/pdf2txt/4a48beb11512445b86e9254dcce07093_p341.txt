The rental deposits increased by RMB1.4 million to RMB2.1 million as of December 31,
2017 from RMB0.7 million as of December 31, 2016. The rental deposits increased slightly by
RMB0.1 million to RMB2.2 million as of June 30, 2018, from RMB2.1 million as of December
31, 2017. The increases were primarily attributable to the rental deposits we made in
connection with the non-cancellable operating leases in respect of our office premises in
Shanghai.

The prepayments primarily consist of prepayments made in connection with purchase of
raw materials and services provided by CROs and hospitals. The prepayments decreased by
RMB6.3 million to RMB15.3 million as of December 31, 2017 from RMB21.6 million as of
December 31, 2016. The prepayments increased slightly by RMB4.7 million to RMB20.0
million as of June 30, 2018, from RMB15.3 million as of December 31, 2017.

We recorded subscription receivables for restricted shares due to issuance of restricted
shares under our Pre-IPO Share Incentive Plan. Subscription receivables for restricted shares
increased by RMB21.3 million to RMB28.7 million as of December 31, 2017 from RMB7.4
million as of December 31, 2016, and further increased to RMB29.0 million as of June 30,
2018. The increases were primarily attributable to the subscription amount owed by Dr. Yu in
connection with the restricted shares issued to him in 2017. Dr. Yu has not paid us the
subscription price of these restricted shares and it is expected that such amount owed by Dr.
Yu will be settled prior to the consummation of the Global Offering.
