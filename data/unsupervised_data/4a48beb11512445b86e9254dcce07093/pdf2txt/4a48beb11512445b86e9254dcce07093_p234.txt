*** We also plan to develop sintilimab in combination with (i) IBI-310 for the treatment of melanoma, SCLC and
RCC, (ii) each of IBI-101, IBI-188, IBI-110 and IBI-939 for the treatment of advanced solid tumors, (iii)
IBI-305 for the treatment of HCC and EGFR-TKI failure NSCLC, and (iv) IBI-301 for the treatment of B-cell
NHL. We also plan to develop IBI-188 in combination with IBI-301 for the treatment of B-cell NHL.

(1) We are developing IBI-310 as an innovative drug candidate in accordance with NMPA regulations because
ipilimumab has not been approved for marketing in China even though IBI-310 has the same amino acid
sequence as ipilimumab.

(2) We and Eli Lilly will co-promote sintilimab (IBI-308) and rituximab (IBI-301) in China, Hong Kong and

Macau.

(3)

Eli Lilly may opt in to co-commercialize IBI-318 and IBI-319 with us in China, Hong Kong and Macau.

We have three bi-specific monoclonal antibody candidates based on sintilimab (IBI-308)
in co-development with Eli Lilly, two of which, IBI-318 and IBI-319, are under development
in China. See “–Collaboration Agreements – Collaboration with Eli Lilly – Addendum to the
Exclusive License and Collaboration Agreement for China” for details.
