Market Opportunity and Competition

Adalimumab has been approved by the EMA and the FDA for the treatment of rheumatoid
juvenile idiopathic arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn’s
arthritis,
disease, ulcerative colitis and psoriasis when conventional
therapies are not sufficiently
effective. Worldwide sales of adalimumab exceeded US$18.9 billion in 2017. According to the
Frost & Sullivan Report, the prevalence of rheumatoid arthritis in China increased from 5.7
million in 2013 to 5.8 million in 2017 and is expected to further increase to 6.0 million by 2022
and 6.2 million by 2030. Also according to the Frost & Sullivan Report, the prevalence of
ankylosing spondylitis in China increased from 3.7 million in 2013 to 3.8 million in 2017 and
is expected to further increase to 3.9 million by 2022 and 4.1 million by 2030.

Adalimumab (sold under the trade name Humira by AbbVie) and golimumab (sold under
the trade name Simponi by Johnson & Johnson) were approved by the NMPA in China as a
treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and psoriasis. Simponi was also
approved in China as a treatment for ulcerative colitis. There are two other adalimumab
biosimilar drug candidates for which NDAs have been submitted to NMPA. Besides our
IBI-303, there are two other adalimumab biosimilar drug candidates in Phase 3 clinical trials
in China.

Competition in the autoimmune therapeutic area to which IBI-303 belongs is extremely
fierce given the abundance of existing competing drugs and drug candidates that continue to
increase competition in the market. The following table sets forth comparisons between
IBI-303 and its competitive drug candidates in China which are approved to market or in late
stage clinical trials:
