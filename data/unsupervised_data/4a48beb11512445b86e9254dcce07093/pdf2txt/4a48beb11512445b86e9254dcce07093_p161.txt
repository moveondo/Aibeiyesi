Overview of PD-1 and PD-L1 Antibodies

PD-1 and PD-L1 antibodies are emerging drugs for the treatment of many cancers.
Compared with chemotherapy, anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 therapies have the following benefits:

Increasing Indications – PD-1 and PD-L1 antibodies display impressive anti-tumor
activity in multiple types of cancer. PD-1 and PD-L1 antibodies show high effectiveness on
melanoma, NSCLC, other solid tumors, etc.

Fewer Side Effects – PD-1 and PD-L1 antibodies are targeted therapeutic approaches.
Compared with chemotherapy, such as docetaxel, in previously treated advanced NSCLC,
Grade 3 or higher adverse events were less likely with PD-1 and PD-L1 therapies.

Superior Efficacy – Therapies combining PD-1 antibodies with chemotherapy have shown
