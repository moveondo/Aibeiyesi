WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ULTIMATELY DEVELOP AND MARKET IBI-302
SUCCESSFULLY.

IBI-307

IBI-307 is a fully human monoclonal antibody drug candidate that we are developing for
the treatment of osteoporosis and lytic bone lesions associated with cancer metastasis. It binds
to RANKL (RANK ligand), a hormone that controls the activation and survival of osteoclasts,
the cells that remodel bone. By blocking the activity of RANKL, bone resorption is inhibited
resulting in stronger and denser bones. According to the Frost & Sullivan Report, approved
RANKL inhibitors include denosumab of Amgen (sold under the trade names Prolia and
XGEVA), which had worldwide sales of US$3.5 billion in 2017; in contrast, there are currently
no RANKL inhibitors approved for marketing in China. We filed an IND application for
IBI-307 with the NMPA in November 2017, which was approved on June 15, 2018.

IBI-101

IBI-101 is a fully human monoclonal antibody drug candidate that we are developing to
treat cancers and hepatitis B. IBI-101 binds to and stimulates OX40, which should increase the
survival and activation of tumor specific T cells. There is currently no OX40 agonist approved
globally. We filed an IND application for IBI-101 with the NMPA in January 2018, which was
approved on June 15, 2018. We also plan to file an IND application for IBI-101 with the FDA
in 2018.

IBI-188

IBI-188 is a fully human monoclonal antibody drug candidate that we are developing for
the treatment of cancers. IBI-188 binds to CD47, a surface protein that provides a “do not eat
me” signal to macrophages. Cancer cells frequently express CD47 and by doing so evade
destruction by macrophage. Our pre-clinical data show that
IBI-188 is efficacious for
inhibiting tumor growth. We filed an IND application for IBI-188 with the NMPA in June 2018,
which was approved on August 22, 2018. We have also begun the process of seeking FDA
marketing authorization for IBI-188, our CD47 antibody. The FDA approved our IND
application for IBI-188 in September 2018. We plan to initiate a Phase 1a clinical trial (dose
escalation) in the U.S. in approximately 17 to 42 patients with cancer. According to Frost &
Sullivan, there are no currently approved anti-CD47 therapies, although many companies are
currently developing candidates that target CD47 in pre-clinical studies and clinical trials. For
example, California-based Forty Seven, Inc.
is evaluating its anti-CD47 antibody drug
candidate in five ongoing monotherapy Phase 1 and combination therapy Phase 1b/2 trials, in
patients with solid tumors, leukemia or lymphoma.
