FINANCIAL INFORMATION

Other government grants related to income receivables as compensation for our expenses
or losses historically incurred or aimed to provide immediate financial support to us which
does not directly relate to our costs to be incurred in the future. Such government grants were
recognized as income in the periods in which they became receivables.

The government grants income increased by RMB27.6 million to RMB56.4 million for
the year ended December 31, 2017, from RMB28.8 million for the year ended December 31,
2016. The government grants income increased by RMB1.1 million to RMB1.8 million for the
six months ended June 30, 2018, from RMB0.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017.
The increases in government grants income were primarily attributable to more research and
development activities that are eligible for government subsidies.

Other Gains and Losses

Other gains and losses consist of unrealized gains and losses related to (i) fair value
changes of wealth management plans (financial assets mandatorily measured at fair value
through profit and loss), (ii) fair value changes of other financial liabilities measured at fair
value through profit and loss, and (iii) changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

Our financial assets mandatorily measured at fair value through profit and loss primarily
consist of wealth management plans managed by major state-owned commercial banks in
China. Gain on fair value changes of financial assets mandatorily measured at fair value
increased by RMB20.2 million to RMB38.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017,
from RMB18.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in gain on fair
value changes of financial assets mandatorily measured at fair value through profit and loss
was primarily attributable to the return we received on the wealth management plans we
purchased in 2017 by using a portion of the proceeds from the Series D equity financing. Gain
on fair value changes of financial assets mandatorily measured at fair value decreased by
RMB7.7 million to RMB2.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018, from RMB10.1
million for the six months ended June 30, 2017, primarily due to maturity of certain wealth
management products that we previously purchased.

Loss on fair value changes of other financial liabilities measured at fair value through
profit and loss decreased by RMB72.2 million to RMB51.0 million for the year ended
December 31, 2017, from RMB123.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The
decrease was primarily attributable to the fair value adjustment we made to the outstanding
convertible redeemable preferred shares. We recorded a gain of RMB448.8 million on fair
value changes of other financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit and loss for the
six months ended June 30, 2018, as compared to a loss of RMB0.8 million on fair value
changes of other financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit and loss for the six
months ended June 30, 2017. The gain was primarily due to the decrease in the fair value of
our series D preferred shares resulted from the new issuance of series E preferred shares in the
first half of 2018. Series E preferred shares replaced series D preferred shares to have the
highest liquidation preference relative to all the preferred shares issued in previous financing
rounds. Lowering liquidation preference led to a downward adjustment on the fair value for
