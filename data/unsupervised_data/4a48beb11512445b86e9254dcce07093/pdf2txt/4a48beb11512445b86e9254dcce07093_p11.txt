SUMMARY

Leveraging our platform, we have built up a pipeline of 17 antibody drug candidates in
the last seven years, led by our four core products that are in late-stage clinical development
in China, including sintilimab (IBI-308), our novel PD-1 antibody; IBI-305, our bevacizumab
(Avastin) biosimilar; IBI-301, our rituximab (MabThera/Rituxan) biosimilar; and IBI-303, our
adalimumab (Humira) biosimilar. In addition, out of our pipeline of 17 antibody drug
candidates, six are in clinical development in China, including two designated as Category 1
drug candidates, which are sintilimab and IBI-306, and four designated as Category 2 drug
candidates,
including IBI-310, IBI-301, IBI-303 and IBI-305. Moreover, four other drug
candidates in our pipeline, IBI-302, IBI-307, IBI-101 and IBI-188, received IND approval in
December 2016, June 2018, June 2018 and August 2018, respectively.

We have three bi-specific monoclonal antibody candidates based on sintilimab (IBI-308)
in co-development with Eli Lilly, two of which, IBI-318 and IBI-319, are under development
in China. See the section headed “Business –Collaboration Agreements–Collaboration with Eli
Lilly–Addendum to the Exclusive License and Collaboration Agreement for China” for details.
Pursuant to our agreement with Eli Lilly, certain specifics of these three bi-specific monoclonal
antibody candidates remain confidential.

In addition to developing our pipeline drug candidates in China, we have obtained FDA
approval for our IND applications for sintilimab (IBI-308) and IBI-188 and plan to initiate a
multi-center Phase 1b/2 clinical trial for sintilimab (IBI-308) and a Phase 1a clinical trial for
IBI-188 in the U.S.

For the two years ended December 31, 2016 and 2017 and the six months ended June 30,
2017 and 2018, our research and development expenses were RMB384.7 million, RMB611.9
million, RMB225.4 million and RMB420.0 million, respectively. As of the Latest Practicable
Date, with respect to our four core product candidates, we owned three issued Chinese patents
and three pending Chinese patent applications, two pending U.S. patent applications, and four
pending PCT applications, among others.
