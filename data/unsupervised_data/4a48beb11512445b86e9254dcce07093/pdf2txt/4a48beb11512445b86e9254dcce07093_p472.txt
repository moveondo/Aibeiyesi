The computation of basic and diluted loss (earnings) per share for each of the years ended 31 December 2016
and 2017 and six months ended 30 June 2017 and 2018 excluded the unvested restricted shares of the Company.
Details of these restricted shares are set out in note 30.

The weighted average number of ordinary shares for the purpose of calculating basic loss (earnings) per share

for the Relevant Periods has been retrospectively adjusted for the share subdivision as disclosed in note 29.

Diluted earnings per share for the six months ended 30 June 2018 did not assume vesting of restricted shares,
conversion of series A, B, C and E Preferred Shares, and exercise of share options, as their inclusion would be
anti-dilutive.

Diluted loss (earnings) per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares
outstanding to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares. The Company had three categories of
potential ordinary shares, unvested restricted shares of the Company (note 30), Preferred Shares issued by the
Company (note 28) and the shares options awarded under the share incentive plan (the “Plan”) (note 30). As the
Group incurred losses for each of the years ended 31 December 2016 and 2017 and the six months ended 30 June
2017, the potential ordinary shares were not included in the calculation of dilutive loss per share, as their inclusion
would be anti-dilutive. Accordingly, dilutive losses per share for each of the years ended 31 December 2016 and 2017
and the six months ended 30 June 2017 are the same as basic loss per share of the respective years/period.
