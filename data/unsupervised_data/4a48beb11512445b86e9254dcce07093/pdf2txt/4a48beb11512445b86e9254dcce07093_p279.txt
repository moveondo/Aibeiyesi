WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ULTIMATELY DEVELOP AND MARKET IBI-310
SUCCESSFULLY.

Our IND-Stage Candidates

We have four IND-stage drug candidates as of the Latest Practicable Date:

IBI-302

IBI-302 is a fully human bi-specific antibody-like drug candidate we are developing to
treat ocular diseases including a type of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) called wet
AMD.

Mechanism of Action

IBI-302 is a bi-specific fusion protein designed with both a VEGF binding domain from
VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 and a complement binding domain called sCR1 (soluble complement
receptor type 1), and the two binding domains are connected by the Fc region of human
immunoglobulin, as shown in the diagram below. IBI-302 binds to and inhibits the action of
both VEGF and complement proteins, which activates the complement cascade that is part of
the immune inflammatory process. Uncontrolled activation of complement and upregulation of
VEGF play fundamental roles in AMD. The root cause of wet AMD is believed to be
complement proteins as opposed to VEGF.

The Structure and Characteristics of IBI-302

Market Opportunity and Competition

AMD is a medical condition characterized by proliferation of abnormal blood vessels in
the retina. Wet AMD, the “wet” form of advanced AMD, is a leading cause of severe vision loss
and blindness in people over the age of 50 in the developed world. If untreated, the blood
vessel growth and leakage associated with wet AMD can eventually lead to blindness. The
majority of patients with wet AMD experience severe vision loss in the affected eye within
