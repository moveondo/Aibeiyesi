Improvements in the binding affinity and in binding kinetics lead to more robust activity
of sintilimab in ex vivo mixed lymphocyte reactions, which is a measure of the ability of human
lymphocytes to recognize foreign cells and become activated. The degree of lymphocyte
activation is measured by the induction of cytokines such as interferon-␥ and interleukin-2
(IL-2). As shown in the figure below, sintilimab leads to greater induction of IL-2 and
interferon-␥ than nivolumab or pembrolizumab, respectively.

mixed lymphocyte reaction cytokine induction

Abbreviations: IL-2 = interleukin-2; IFN-␥ = interferon-␥; IgG = immunoglobulin G.

In another laboratory study,

the ability of sintilimab to change the types of tumor
infiltrating T lymphocytes (TILs) in human xenographs was compared directly against that of
pembrolizumab and nivolumab. A proximate measure of blockade of PD-1 action in tumors is
CD8/Treg, which is the ratio of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CD8) to Treg lymphocytes. While each
PD-1 antibody increased the ratio of CD8/Treg lymphocytes, at the equivalent dose levels,
sintilimab led to more robust changes, as shown in the figure below. This increase in CD8/Treg
ratio is a beneficial change in the immune status within the tumors.
