APPENDIX I

ACCOUNTANTS’ REPORT

The Preferred Shares, gross obligations from Share Purchase Option written and Shares Purchase Options were
valued by the directors of the Company with reference to valuation reports carried out by an independent qualified
professional valuer, Solium Analytics LLC, which has appropriate qualifications and experiences in valuation of
similar instruments. The address of Solium Analytics LLC is Suite 780, 221 Main Street, San Francisco, California
94105.

The Company used the back-solve method to determine the underlying share value of the Company and
performed an equity allocation based on a Black-Scholes Option Pricing model (“OPM model”) to arrive the fair
value of the Preferred Shares as of the dates of issuance and at the end of each reporting period.

In addition to the underlying share value of the Company determined by back-solve method, other key

valuation assumptions used in OPM model to determine the fair value of the Preferred Shares are as follows:

Time to liquidity
Risk-free interest rate
Volatility
Dividend Yield
Possibilities under liquidation scenario
Possibilities under IPO scenario

The directors of the Company estimated the risk-free interest rate based on the yield of U.S. Treasury Bonds
with a maturity life closed to period from the respective valuation dates to the expected liquidation dates. Volatility
was estimated on each valuation date based on average of historical volatilities of the comparable companies in the
same industry for a period from the respective valuation dates to expected liquidation dates.

Changes in fair value of the other financial liabilities were recorded in “(loss) gain on fair value changes of
other financial liabilities measured at FVTPL”. Management considered that fair value change in the Preferred Shares
that are attributable to changes of credit risk of this liability being not significant.

As at 31 December 2016 and 2017 and 30 June 2018, other financial liabilities shall be redeemed by the
Company at an amount equal to the issue price per share, plus an 11% compounded annual interest and any declared
but unpaid dividends, within a period of more than two years but not exceeding five years.
