We have established an audit committee which (i) makes recommendations to our
Directors on the appointment and removal of external auditors; and (ii) reviews the
financial statements and renders advice in respect of financial reporting as well as
oversees internal control procedures of our Group.

We have engaged Guotai Junan Capital Limited as our compliance adviser to
provide advice to our Directors and management team until the end of the first fiscal
year after
the Listing regarding matters relating to the Listing Rules. Our
compliance adviser is expected to ensure our use of funding complies with the
sections entitled “Future Plans and Use of Proceeds” in this prospectus after the
Listing, as well as to provide support and advice regarding requirements of relevant
regulatory authorities in a timely fashion.

We plan to engage a PRC law firm to advise us on and keep us abreast with PRC
laws and regulations after the Listing. We will continue to arrange various trainings
to be provided by external legal advisers from time to time when necessary and/or
any appropriate accredited institution to update our Directors, senior management,
and relevant employees on the latest PRC laws and regulations.

We maintain strict anti-corruption policies among our
sales personnel and
distributors in our sales and marketing activities and we believe we will therefore be
less affected by the increasingly stringent measures taken by the PRC government
to correct corruptive practices in the pharmaceutical industry. We also ensure that
our
sales and marketing personnel comply with applicable promotion and
advertising requirements, which include restrictions on promoting drugs for
unapproved uses or patient populations, also known as off-label use, and limitations
on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities.
