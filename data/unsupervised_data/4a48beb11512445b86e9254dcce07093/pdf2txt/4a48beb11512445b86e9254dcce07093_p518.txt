APPENDIX III

SUMMARY OF THE CONSTITUTION OF THE
COMPANY AND CAYMAN COMPANIES LAW

(c)

sub-divide its shares or any of them into shares of smaller amount than is fixed by
the Memorandum of Association, subject nevertheless to the provisions of the
Companies Law, and so that the resolution whereby any share is sub-divided may
determine that, as between the holders of the shares resulting from such sub-
division, one or more of the shares may have any such preferred or other special
rights, over, or may have such deferred rights or be subject to any such restrictions
as compared with the others as the Company has power to attach to unissued or new
shares.

The Company may by special resolution reduce its share capital or any capital redemption
reserve in any manner authorised and subject to any conditions prescribed by the Companies
Law.

2.6 Special resolution – majority required

A “special resolution” is defined in the Articles of Association to have the meaning
ascribed thereto in the Companies Law, for which purpose, the requisite majority shall be not
less than three-fourths of the votes of such members of the Company as, being entitled to do
so, vote in person or, in the case of corporations, by their duly authorised representatives or,
where proxies are allowed, by proxy at a general meeting of which notice specifying the
intention to propose the resolution as a special resolution has been duly given and includes a
special resolution approved in writing by all of the members of the Company entitled to vote
at a general meeting of the Company in one or more instruments each signed by one or more
of such members, and the effective date of the special resolution so adopted shall be the date
on which the instrument or the last of such instruments (if more than one) is executed.

In contrast, an “ordinary resolution” is defined in the Articles of Association to mean a
resolution passed by a simple majority of the votes of such members of the Company as, being
entitled to do so, vote in person or, in the case of corporations, by their duly authorised
representatives or, where proxies are allowed, by proxy at a general meeting held in accordance
with the Articles of Association and includes an ordinary resolution approved in writing by all
the members of the Company aforesaid.

2.7 Voting rights

Subject to any special rights, privileges or restrictions as to voting for the time being
attached to any class or classes of shares, at any general meeting on a poll every member
present in person (or, in the case of a member being a corporation, by its duly authorised
representative) or by proxy shall have one vote for each share registered in his name in the
register of members of the Company.

Where any member is, under the Listing Rules, required to abstain from voting on any
particular resolution or restricted to voting only for or only against any particular resolution,
any votes cast by or on behalf of such member in contravention of such requirement or
restriction shall not be counted.
