Cell-based potency assay shows similarity in potency between IBI-305 and Avastin

Step 2: Pre-clinical Studies

We have performed comprehensive pre-clinical studies of IBI-305 and the results indicate
that IBI-305 has an efficacy, toxicity and PK/PD profile which is similar to that of Avastin.

The figure below demonstrates that, at both 1.5 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg dosage levels, there
were no statistical differences in the relative tumor volume between IBI-305 dosed animals and
Avastin dosed animals. These results indicate similarity in tumor-suppressive efficacy between
IBI-305 and Avastin.

The anti-tumor efficacy of IBI-305 and bevacizumab are similar

The PK profiles of IBI-305 and Avastin are highly similar. As shown in the figure below,
there were no statistical differences in drug concentration between IBI-305 dosed animals and
Avastin dosed animals at the same time points throughout the study. These results indicate the
similarity in the PK profile between IBI-305 and Avastin.
