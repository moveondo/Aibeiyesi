Sensitivity analysis

The following table details the Group’s sensitivity to a 5% increase in RMB against USD. 5% is the
sensitivity rate used which represents management’s assessment of the reasonably possible change in foreign
exchange rates. The sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary
items and adjusts their translation at the end of the reporting period for a 5% change in foreign currency rates.
A negative number below indicates a decrease in post tax loss where RMB strengthens 5% against USD. For
a 5% weakening of RMB against the relevant currency, there would be an equal and opposite impact on the
profit.

The directors of the Company considered the sensitivity analysis is unrepresentative of the inherent
foreign exchange risk as the exposure at the end of each reporting period does not reflect the exposure during
the relevant periods.
