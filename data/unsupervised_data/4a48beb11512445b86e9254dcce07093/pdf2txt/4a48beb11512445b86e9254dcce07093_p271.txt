We also performed another study in cynomolgus monkeys to characterize and compare the
PK profile of IBI-303 against that of Humira. As shown in the figure below, there were no
statistical differences in drug concentration between IBI-303 dosed animals and Humira dosed
animals at the same time points throughout the study. These results indicate the similarity in
the PK profile between IBI-303 and Humira.

IBI-303 and adalimumab (Humira) have highly similar PK profiles

after a single dose in cynomolgus monkeys

Step 3: Clinical Pharmacology Study

Our IND application for IBI-303 was approved by the NMPA in December 2015 in
accordance with the biosimilar regulatory development pathway based on the demonstrated
similarity to the reference product in the CMC and pre-clinical studies. We have substantially
completed a randomized double-blind clinical trial in China to assess the bioequivalence,
pharmacokinetics, safety and immunogenicity of IBI-303 in comparison with Humira in 183
healthy volunteers. The primary endpoints of the study are Cmax, AUC0-inf and AUC0-t.

The study procedures have been completed with all

trial subjects as of the Latest
Practicable Date. We are in the process of analyzing the trial data and we expect to complete
analysis of the trial data in the second half of 2018 and to report the results thereafter at a
scientific conference or other appropriate forum.

We have not seen unexpected adverse events with IBI-303 in this study. Safety data from
these small and short clinical pharmacology studies aimed at establishing bioequivalence are
not useful, representative or material. The useful or material safety data set only comes from
the large and lengthy clinical confirmation studies at Step 4.
