Fortunately, with sintilimab, this does not appear to be the case. 567 patients have been treated
with sintilimab as of the Latest Practicable Date and the results from our clinical studies, albeit
not head-to-head comparisons, have demonstrated that the safety profile of sintilimab is similar
to that of pembrolizumab with no unexpected adverse events. In most of these clinical studies,
the dose level and frequency of administration of sintilimab is identical
to that of
pembrolizumab, i.e., 200 mg flat dose given intravenously every three weeks. As shown in the
following tables, in all categories of adverse events collected in our ongoing trials in 371
patients, sintilimab has numerically lower frequency of adverse events than reported in the
pembrolizumab reference safety dataset.
