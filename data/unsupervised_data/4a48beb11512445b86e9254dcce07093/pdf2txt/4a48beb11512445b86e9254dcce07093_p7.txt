CHAIRMAN’S LETTER

Dear investors,

Thank you for your support for Innovent Biologics, Inc. (“Innovent”). As we are about to
embark on a new journey, I wanted to express my gratitude for your continued interest and
support.

At this special moment, I would like to share with you my fundamental beliefs when I
founded Innovent and our development over the past seven years, so that you can understand
why we set out on this path and what we are striving to achieve.

Before founding Innovent, I was an explorer on the long and winding path of innovation
in biopharmaceuticals. From a cattle raising boy deep in the mountains of China to a college
graduate in a big city; from a Ph.D. at the Chinese Academy of Sciences to a postdoctoral
fellow at the University of California San Francisco (UCSF), I became one of the scientists in
the forefront of the development of biopharmaceuticals in the United States.

Conquering cancer – making cancers and other serious diseases that threaten human life
and health become treatable and curable – is a major challenge in the field of life sciences.
Biological medicines that bring together the latest achievements in life sciences, especially
antibody drugs at the vanguard of biopharmaceutical research, are getting closer to overcoming
this challenge. Being part of such an exciting field, we face tremendous obstacles that often
keep me awake at night but also motivate me to work harder and continue to explore.

But real life concerns have often led me to wonder: what is the ultimate purpose of

scientific exploration?

Biological drugs are within easy reach for patients in developed countries such as the
United States, and those who are critically ill with cancer and other diseases are treatable and
curable; while the vast majority of patients in China are faced with the dire reality in which
they cannot buy or cannot afford biological drugs.
