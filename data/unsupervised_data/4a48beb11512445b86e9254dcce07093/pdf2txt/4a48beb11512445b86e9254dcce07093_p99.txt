RISK FACTORS

under the relevant agreement, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. Moreover, if disputes over
intellectual property that we have licensed prevent or impair our ability to maintain our current
licensing arrangements on commercially acceptable terms, we may be unable to successfully
develop and commercialize the affected drug candidates, which could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial conditions, results of operations, and prospects.

Intellectual property rights do not necessarily address all potential threats.

The degree of future protection afforded by our intellectual property rights is uncertain
because intellectual property rights have limitations, and may not adequately protect our
business or permit us to maintain our competitive advantage. For example:

others may be able to make products that are similar to any drug candidates we may
develop or utilize similar technology that are not covered by the claims of the
patents that we own or license now or in the future;

we, or our license partners or current or future collaborators, might not have been
the first to make the inventions covered by the issued patent or pending patent
application that we license or may own in the future;

we, or our license partners or current or future collaborators, might not have been
the first to file patent applications covering certain of our or their inventions;

others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate
any of our technologies without infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating
our owned or licensed intellectual property rights;

it is possible that our pending licensed patent applications or those that we may own
in the future will not lead to issued patents;

issued patents that we hold rights to may be held invalid or unenforceable, including
as a result of legal challenges by our competitors;

our competitors might conduct research and development activities in countries
where we do not have patent rights and then use the information learned from such
activities to develop competitive products for sale in our major commercial markets;

we may not develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable;

the patents of others may harm our business; and

we may choose not to file a patent for certain trade secrets or know-how, and a third
party may subsequently file a patent covering such intellectual property.

Should any of these events occur, they could have a material adverse effect on our

business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
