STATUTORY AND GENERAL INFORMATION

(a) Purpose

The purpose of the Pre-IPO Share Incentive Plan is to promote the success of the
Company and the interests of its shareholders by providing a means through which the
Company may grant equity-based incentives to attract, motivate, retain and reward certain
officers, employees, directors and other eligible persons and to further link the interests
of Award recipients with those of the Company’s shareholders generally.

(b) Who may join

Those eligible to participate in the Pre-IPO Share Incentive Plan include employees,
advisers or consultants, all members of the Board of Directors (the “Board”) and other
individuals, as determined, authorized and approved by the Board or a committee
authorized by the Board (the “Administrator”). The Administrator may, from time to
time, select from among all eligible individuals (“Participants”) to whom awards in the
form of options (“Options”), share appreciation rights (“SARs”) and ordinary or
restricted share awards (“Share Awards”) (collectively “Awards”), will be granted and
will determine the nature and amount of each option. A person’s status as an Eligible
Person is not a commitment that any Award will be granted to that person under the
Pre-IPO Share Incentive Plan. Nil consideration was paid by the grantees for the grant of
Awards under the Pre-IPO Share Incentive Plan.

(c) Maximum number of Ordinary Shares with a par value of US$0.00001 each

The overall limit on the number of underlying shares which may be delivered
pursuant to Awards granted under the Pre-IPO Share Incentive Plan is 162,010,040 of the
Company’s authorized but unissued Ordinary Shares with a par value of US$0.00001
each, subject to any adjustments for other dilutive issuances.

committees appointed by the Board or another committee (within its delegated authority)
