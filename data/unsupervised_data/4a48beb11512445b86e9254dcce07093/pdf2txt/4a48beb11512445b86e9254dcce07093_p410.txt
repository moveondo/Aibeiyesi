STRUCTURE OF THE GLOBAL OFFERING

THE INTERNATIONAL OFFERING

Number of Offer Shares initially offered

The International Offering will consist of an offering of initially 212,715,000 Shares,
representing 90.0% of the total number of Offer Shares initially available under the Global
Offering (subject to reallocation and the Over-allotment Option). The number of Offer Shares
initially offered under the International Offering, subject to any reallocation of Offer Shares
between the International Offering and the Hong Kong Public Offering, will represent
approximately 19.0% of the total Shares in issue immediately following the completion of the
Global Offering (assuming the Over-allotment Option is not exercised and no shares are issued
pursuant to the Equity Plans).

Allocation

The International Offering will include selective marketing of Offer Shares to QIBs in the
United States as well as institutional and professional investors and other investors anticipated
to have a sizeable demand for such Offer Shares in Hong Kong and other jurisdictions outside
the United States in reliance on Regulation S. Professional investors generally include brokers,
dealers, companies (including fund managers) whose ordinary business involves dealing in
shares and other securities and corporate entities that regularly invest in shares and other
securities. Allocation of Offer Shares pursuant to the International Offering will be effected in
accordance with the “book-building” process described in sub-section headed “Pricing and
Allocation” in this section and based on a number of factors, including the level and timing of
demand, the total size of the relevant investor’s invested assets or equity assets in the relevant
sector and whether or not it is expected that the relevant investor is likely to buy further Shares
and/or hold or sell its Shares after the Listing. Such allocation is intended to result in a
distribution of the Shares on a basis which would lead to the establishment of a solid
professional and institutional shareholder base to the benefit of the Group and the Shareholders
as a whole.

The Joint Global Coordinators (on behalf of the Underwriters) may require any investor
who has been offered Offer Shares under the International Offering and who has made an
application under the Hong Kong Public Offering to provide sufficient information to the Joint
Global Coordinators so as to allow it to identify the relevant applications under the Hong Kong
Public Offering and to ensure that they are excluded from any allocation of Offer Shares under
the Hong Kong Public Offering.

Reallocation

The total number of Offer Shares to be issued or sold pursuant to the International
Offering may change as a result of the clawback arrangement described in the subsection “The
Hong Kong Public Offering – Reallocation” in this section above,
the exercise of the
Over-allotment Option in whole or in part and/or any reallocation of unsubscribed Offer Shares
originally included in the Hong Kong Public Offering.
