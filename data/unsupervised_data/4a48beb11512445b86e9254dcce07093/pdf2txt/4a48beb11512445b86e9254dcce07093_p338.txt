FINANCIAL INFORMATION

Finance Costs

Finance costs include interest on our bank borrowings and interest arising from a contract

containing a significant financing component.

The stated amount of the consideration under such contract is adjusted based on the time
value of such consideration if the timing of the payment of such consideration could be
considered as providing us with a significant benefit similar to a financing provided by the
customer under such contract.

Interest arising from a contract containing a significant financing component increased by
RMB5.0 million to RMB32.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, from RMB27.3
million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Interest arising from a contract containing a
significant financing component increased by RMB4.4 million, to RMB20.5 million for the six
months ended June 30, 2018, from RMB16.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017.
The increases were primarily attributable to the increase in the average balance of the payments
that we have received in advance in connection with the commercialization license from Eli
Lilly so far pursuant to the Lilly China Agreement.

Income Tax Expense

For the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 and the years ended December 31, 2016
and 2017, we had no taxable income and therefore we had no income tax expenses. See note
13 to the Accountants’ Report set out in Appendix I.
