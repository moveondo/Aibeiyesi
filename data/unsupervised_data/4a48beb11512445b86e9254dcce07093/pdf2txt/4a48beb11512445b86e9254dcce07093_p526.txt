APPENDIX III

SUMMARY OF THE CONSTITUTION OF THE
COMPANY AND CAYMAN COMPANIES LAW

A call may be made payable either in one sum or by instalments and shall be deemed to
have been made at the time when the resolution of the Directors authorising the call was
passed. The joint holders of a share shall be jointly and severally liable to pay all calls and
instalments due in respect of such share or other monies due in respect thereof.

If a sum called in respect of a share shall not be paid before or on the day appointed for
payment thereof, the person from whom the sum is due shall pay interest on the sum from the
day appointed for payment thereof to the time of actual payment at such rate, not exceeding
15% per annum, as the Directors may determine, but the Directors shall be at liberty to waive
payment of such interest wholly or in part.

If any call or instalment of a call remains unpaid on any share after the day appointed for
payment thereof, the Directors may at any time during such time as any part thereof remains
unpaid serve a notice on the holder of such shares requiring payment of so much of the call or
instalment as is unpaid together with any interest which may be accrued and which may still
accrue up to the date of actual payment.

The notice shall name a further day (not being less than 14 days from the date of service
of the notice) on or before which, and the place where, the payment required by the notice is
to be made, and shall state that in the event of non-payment at or before the time and at the
place appointed, the shares in respect of which such call was made or instalment is unpaid will
be liable to be forfeited.

If the requirements of such notice are not complied with, any share in respect of which
such notice has been given may at any time thereafter, before payment of all calls or
instalments and interest due in respect thereof has been made, be forfeited by a resolution of
the Directors to that effect. Such forfeiture shall include all dividends and bonuses declared in
respect of the forfeited shares and not actually paid before the forfeiture. A forfeited share shall
be deemed to be the property of the Company and may be re-allotted, sold or otherwise
disposed of.

A person whose shares have been forfeited shall cease to be a member of the Company
in respect of the forfeited shares but shall, notwithstanding the forfeiture, remain liable to pay
to the Company all monies which at the date of forfeiture were payable by him to the Company
in respect of the shares, together with (if the Directors shall in their discretion so require)
interest thereon at such rate not exceeding 15% per annum as the Directors may prescribe from
the date of forfeiture until payment, and the Directors may enforce payment thereof without
being under any obligation to make any allowance for the value of the shares forfeited, at the
date of forfeiture.
