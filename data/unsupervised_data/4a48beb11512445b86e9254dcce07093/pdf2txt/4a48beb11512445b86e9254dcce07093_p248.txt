natural killer/T-cell lymphoma; ESCC = esophageal squamous cell carcinoma; NSCLC = non-small cell
lung cancer; EGFR = epidermal growth factor receptor; TKI = tyrosine kinase inhibitor.

Some indications may not require every clinical trial indicated on this chart to be completed prior to the
filing of an NDA.

We have conducted a multi-center Phase 1a (dose escalation) study in China to evaluate
the safety and efficacy of sintilimab as a monotherapy in cancer patients with no available
standard of care therapy. We enrolled 12 patients and studied four Q3W dose strengths: 1
mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, 200 mg flat dose and 10 mg/kg. Four drug-related SAEs were observed, but
no dose limiting toxicity was observed. Three patients are still on treatment and two partial
responses (PRs) have been observed. Based on the results of this study, 200 mg flat dose was
selected for further study.
