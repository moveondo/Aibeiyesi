CHAIRMAN’S LETTER

Through our efforts, we hope that patients in China with cancer and other serious diseases
will be able to buy more affordable, innovative, Chinese drugs with similar or better efficacy
to those currently available in developed countries like the United States. The immense
innovations in Chinese biopharmaceuticals are becoming a force to be reckoned with in the
global biopharmaceutical industry.

In the past seven years, I have also discovered a more profound answer to my question
about
the ultimate purpose of scientific exploration. The ultimate purpose of scientific
exploration is to enable everyone to share the best possible health benefits that are attainable
as a result of scientific and technological advancement. It is to accomplish something great
with one’s lifelong commitment – to exert one’s full strength and potential for the betterment
of the health and lives of the greatest number of people. It is to work hard with passion and
perseverance to contribute to this great and exciting time in history in which we fortunately
live.
