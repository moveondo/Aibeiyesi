One major mechanism of action of rituximab is complement-dependent cytotoxicity
(CDC). A cell-based potency assay based on the accurate measurement of CDC demonstrated
equivalent in vitro potency between IBI-301 and Rituxan. As shown in the left panel of the
following figure, when increasing concentrations of the two antibodies are incubated in the
reporter assay, the CDC activities as measured by cellular lysis are identical. The right hand
panel of
the following figure shows
IBI-301 and rituximab
(MabThera/Rituxan) have similar potency.

Step 2: Pre-clinical Studies

We have performed comprehensive pre-clinical studies of IBI-301 and the results indicate
that IBI-301 has an efficacy, toxicity and PK/PD profile which is similar to that of Rituxan.

The figure below shows that both of IBI-301 and rituximab (MabThera/Rituxan) are
effective in the complete and persistent depletion of CD20 positive B cells in the peripheral
circulation of monkeys after a single dose of 30 mg/kg. These results indicate similarity in
efficacy between IBI-301 and rituximab (MabThera/Rituxan).
