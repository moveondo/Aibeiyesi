following failure of one prior line of therapy; there is no approved PD-L1 antibody yet. CDE
released guidance in February 2018 on the requirements for NDA submissions of PD-1/PD-L1
drug candidates, specifically for data from single-arm trials on refractory/recurrent advanced
cancers without standard-of-care therapies. A pre-NDA meeting is required before the NDA
submission, and a rolling NDA submission will be accepted for PD1-/PD-L1 therapies. Besides
us, several companies also have anti-PD-1 drug candidates with an NDA application under
review by the NMPA for the first indications, including Hengrui’s SHR-1210 (camrelizumab),
Junshi’s JS-001 (toripalimab), and BeiGene’s BGB-A317 (tislelizumab). There are also several
anti-PD-1/PD-L1 drug candidates in late-stage clinical development
including
(atezolizumab), CStone’s CS1001, Alphamab/3DMed’s KN035,
Roche’s Tecentriq
AstraZeneca/MedImmune’s
(durvalumab) and Merck KGaA/Pfizer’s Bavencio
(avelumab). According to the Frost & Sullivan Report,
the market size for PD-1/PD-L1
antibodies in China is expected to grow to RMB98.4 billion in 2030.

According to the Frost & Sullivan Report, the worldwide sales for Opdivo (nivolumab)
and Keytruda (pembrolizumab) in 2017 were US$5.8 billion and US$3.8 billion, respectively.
The two approved PD-1 antibodies (Keytruda and Opdivo) and the three approved PD-L1
antibodies (Tecentriq, Bavencio and Imfinzi) in the aggregate had worldwide sales of US$10.1
billion in 2017, which grew at a CAGR of 412.2% from 2014. With the increase in approved
cancer indications for PD-1/PD-L1 antibody drugs and the launch of combination therapies
including PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies, it is expected that the sales for this class will continue to
grow over the next ten years and will reach US$78.9 billion in 2030. See “Industry Overview
– Overview of PD-1 and PD-L1 Antibodies Market” for further information on the market
opportunities for PD-1/PD-L1 antibody drugs.

Competition in the oncology therapeutic area to which sintilimab (IBI-308) belongs is
extremely fierce given the abundance of existing competing drugs and drug candidates that
continue to increase competition in the market. The following table sets forth comparisons
between IBI-308 and its competitive drug candidates in China which are approved to market
or in late stage clinical trials:
