A. UNAUDITED PRO FORMA STATEMENT OF ADJUSTED CONSOLIDATED NET

COMPANY

The unaudited pro forma statement of adjusted consolidated net tangible assets of the
Group prepared in accordance with Rule 4.29 of the Listing Rules is set out below to illustrate
the effect of the proposed Hong Kong public offering and international offering of the Shares
of the Company (the “Global Offering”) on the consolidated net tangible liabilities of the
Group attributable to owners of the Company as at 30 June 2018 as if the Global Offering had
taken place on such date.

This unaudited pro forma statement of adjusted consolidated net tangible assets of the
Group attributable to owners of the Company has been prepared for illustrative purpose only
and, because of its hypothetical nature, it may not give a true picture of the consolidated net
tangible assets of the Group attributable to owners of the Company as at 30 June 2018 or at
any further dates following the Global Offering.

of the Group is prepared based on the audited consolidated net tangible liabilities of the Group
