Drug Substance and Drug Product Manufacturing: After
processes and the related assays are validated,
the processes and assays are
transferred to large scale manufacturing facilities where our drug candidates for
clinical trials and for future commercialization are produced. Our manufacturing
capabilities include both drug substance and drug product manufacturing, from
upstream cell culture, downstream purification, formulation, sterile filling and
packaging. Single-use technologies have been used in our drug substance
manufacturing. A larger scale stainless steel bioreactor facility is under construction.

The following diagram illustrates the basic process for manufacturing our monoclonal
antibodies. Certain aspects of the process vary by the specific monoclonal antibodies being
manufactured.
