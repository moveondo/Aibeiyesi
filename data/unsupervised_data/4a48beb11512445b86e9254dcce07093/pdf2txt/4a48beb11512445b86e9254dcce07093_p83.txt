RISK FACTORS

our drug candidates that are in clinical trials for the same or similar cancer indications. In
addition, physicians, patients and third-party payors may prefer other novel products to ours.
If our drug candidates do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance, we may not generate
significant product sales revenues and we may not become profitable. The degree of market
acceptance of our drug candidates, if approved for commercial sale, will depend on a number
of factors, including:

the clinical indications for which our drug candidates are approved;

physicians, hospitals, cancer treatment centers and patients considering our drug
candidates as a safe and effective treatment;

the potential and perceived advantages of our drug candidates over alternative
treatments;

the prevalence and severity of any side effects;

product labeling or product insert requirements of regulatory authorities;

limitations or warnings contained in the labeling approved by regulatory authorities;

the timing of market introduction of our drug candidates as well as competitive
drugs;

the cost of treatment in relation to alternative treatments;

the availability of adequate coverage, reimbursement and pricing by third-party
payors and government authorities;

the willingness of patients to pay out-of-pocket in the absence of coverage and
reimbursement by third-party payors and government authorities; and

the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts.

If any approved drug candidates that we commercialize fail to achieve market acceptance
among physicians, patients, hospitals, cancer treatment centers or others in the medical
community, we will not be able to generate significant revenue. Even if our future approved
drug candidates achieve market acceptance, we may not be able to maintain that market
acceptance over time if new products or technologies are introduced that are more favorably
received than our drug candidates, are more cost-effective or render our drug candidates
obsolete.
