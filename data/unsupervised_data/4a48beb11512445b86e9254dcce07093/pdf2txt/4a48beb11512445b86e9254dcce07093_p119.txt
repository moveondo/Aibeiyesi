RISK FACTORS

The PRC government may continue to strengthen its capital controls, and more
restrictions and substantial vetting process may be put forward by the SAFE for cross-border
transactions falling under both the current account and the capital account. Any limitation on
the ability of our PRC subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other kinds of payments to us
could materially and adversely limit our ability to grow, make investments or acquisitions that
could be beneficial to our business, pay dividends to our investors or other obligations to our
suppliers, or otherwise fund and conduct our business.

The Enterprise Income Tax Law and its implementation rules provide that China-sourced
income of foreign enterprises, such as dividends paid by a PRC subsidiary to its equity holders
that are non-PRC resident enterprises, will normally be subject to PRC withholding tax at a rate
of 10%, unless any such foreign investor’s jurisdiction of incorporation has a tax treaty with
China that provides for a different withholding arrangement. As a result, dividends paid to us
by our PRC subsidiaries are expected to be subject to PRC withholding tax at a rate of 10%.

Pursuant

to the Arrangement between Mainland China and Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and Prevention of Fiscal Evasion
with respect to Taxes on Income, or the Hong Kong Tax Treaty, Innovent Biologics (HK)
Limited, the shareholder of Innovent Suzhou, may be subject to a withholding tax at a rate of
5% on dividends received from our PRC operating subsidiaries as a Hong Kong tax resident.
Pursuant to the Hong Kong Tax Treaty, subject to certain conditions, this reduced withholding
tax rate will be available for dividends from PRC entities provided that the recipient can
demonstrate it is a Hong Kong tax resident and it is the beneficial owner of the dividends.
However, there is no assurance that the reduced withholding tax rate will be available.

We may be treated as a resident enterprise for PRC tax purposes under the Enterprise
Income Tax Law and we may therefore be subject to PRC income tax on our worldwide
taxable income. Dividends payable to foreign investors and gains on the sale of our Shares
by our foreign investors may become subject to PRC tax.

In addition,

Under the Enterprise Income Tax Law, an enterprise established outside the PRC with “de
facto management bodies” within China is considered a “resident enterprise,” meaning that it
is treated in a manner similar to a Chinese enterprise for PRC enterprise income tax, or EIT,
purposes. The implementing rules of the Enterprise Income Tax Law define “de facto
management bodies” as “management bodies that exercise substantial and overall management
and control over the production and operations, personnel, accounting, and properties” of the
enterprise.
the Notice Regarding the Determination of Chinese-Controlled
Offshore Incorporated Enterprises as PRC Tax Resident Enterprises on the Basis of De Facto
Management Bodies, or Circular 82, specifies that certain Chinese-controlled offshore
incorporated enterprises, defined as enterprises incorporated under
foreign
countries or territories and that have PRC enterprises or enterprise groups as their primary
controlling shareholders, will be classified as resident enterprises if all of the following are
located or resident
in China: (i) senior management personnel and departments that are
responsible for daily production, operation and management; (ii) financial and personnel
decision-making bodies; (iii) key properties, accounting books, company seal, and minutes of
