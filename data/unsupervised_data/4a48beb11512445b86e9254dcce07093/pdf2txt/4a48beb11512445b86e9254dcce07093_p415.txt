STRUCTURE OF THE GLOBAL OFFERING

Before submitting applications for the Hong Kong Offer Shares, applicants should have
regard to the possibility that any announcement of a reduction in the number of Offer Shares
and/or the Offer Price range may not be made until the last day for lodging applications under
the Hong Kong Public Offering. Such notice will also include confirmation or revision, as
appropriate, of the working capital statement and the Global Offering statistics as currently set
out in this prospectus, and any other financial information which may change as a result of any
such reduction. In the absence of any such notice so published, the number of Offer Shares will
not be reduced and/or the Offer Price, if agreed upon by the Joint Global Coordinators (on
behalf of the Underwriters) and the Company, will under no circumstances be set outside the
Offer Price Range as stated in this prospectus.

The final Offer Price, the level of indications of interest in the International Offering, the
level of applications in the Hong Kong Public Offering, the basis of allocations of the Hong
Kong Offer Shares and the results of allocations in the Hong Kong Public Offering are
expected to be made available through a variety of channels in the manner described in the
section headed “How to Apply for Hong Kong Offer Shares – Publication of Results” in this
prospectus.
