A cell-based potency assay demonstrated that IBI-303 and Humira have similar in vitro
potency. As shown in the left hand panel of the following figure, when increasing concentration
of IBI-303 and Humira are incubated in the reporter assay, both antibodies neutralize the
TNF-␣ with identical potency, as measured by the viability of a TNF-␣ dependent cell line. The
right hand panel of the following figure demonstrates that multiple lots of IBI-303 and Humira
have similar potency.

Step 2: Pre-clinical Studies

We have performed comprehensive pre-clinical studies of

IBI-303 in mice with
rheumatoid arthritis and the results indicate that IBI-303 has an efficacy, toxicity and PK/PD
profile which is similar to that of Humira.

As shown in the following figure, arthritic score curves generated from our studies
demonstrated the efficacy similarity between IBI-303 and Humira at two different dose levels.

The efficacy of IBI-303 and adalimumab (Humira) in a human TNF-␣

dependent mouse model of rheumatoid arthritis is highly similar
