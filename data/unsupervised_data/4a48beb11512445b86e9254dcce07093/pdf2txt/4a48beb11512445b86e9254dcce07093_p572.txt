APPENDIX IV

STATUTORY AND GENERAL INFORMATION

(q) Rights on takeover and schemes of compromise or arrangement

If a general offer by way of takeover is made to all the holders of Shares (or all such
holders other than the offeror and/or any person controlled by the offeror and/or any person
acting in association or concert with the offeror), and the offer becomes or is declared
unconditional in all respects, the grantee shall be entitled to exercise the option (to the extent
not already exercised) at any time within one month (or such other period as the Board or its
delegate(s) may decide in their sole discretion) after the date on which the offer becomes or
is declared unconditional. If the option is not exercised within the time specified, the option
shall lapse.

If a compromise or arrangement between the Company and its members or creditors is
proposed, our Company shall give notice to the grantee on the same date as it despatches the
notice to each member or creditor of the Company summoning the meeting to consider such
a compromise or arrangement, and thereupon the grantee (or his personal representatives) may
until the expiry of the period commencing with such date and ending with earlier of the date
two calendar months thereafter or the date on which such compromise or arrangement is
sanctioned by the court exercise any of his options (to the extent not already exercised) whether
in full or in part, but the exercise of an option as aforesaid shall be conditional upon such
compromise or arrangement being sanctioned by the court and becoming effective, and upon
such compromise or arrangement becoming effective, all options shall lapse except insofar as
previously exercised under the Post-IPO ESOP. Our Company may require the grantee to
transfer or otherwise deal with the Shares issued as a result of the exercise of options in these
circumstances so as to place the grantee in the same position, as nearly as possible, as would
have been the case had such Shares been subject to such compromise or arrangement. If the
option is not exercised within the time specified, the option shall lapse.

(r) Rights on a voluntary winding up

In the event a notice is given by our Company to its members to convene a general
meeting for the purposes of considering, and if thought fit, approving a resolution to
voluntarily wind-up our Company, our Company shall on the same date as or soon after it
dispatches such notice to each member of our Company give notice thereof to all grantees
(together with a notice of the existence of the provisions of this sub-paragraph) and thereupon,
each grantee (or his personal representatives) shall be entitled to exercise all or any of his
options (to the extent not already exercised) at any time not later than two business days prior
to the proposed general meeting of our Company by giving notice in writing to our Company,
accompanied by a remittance for the full amount of the aggregate subscription price for the
Shares in respect of which the notice is given whereupon our Company shall as soon as
possible and, in any event, no later than the business day immediately prior to the date of the
proposed general meeting referred to above, allot the relevant Shares to the grantee credited as
fully paid. If the option is not exercised within the time specified, the option shall lapse.
