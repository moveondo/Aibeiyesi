collaborators have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources
that they will apply to a collaboration;

collaborators may not pursue development and commercialization of our drug
candidates or may elect not to continue or renew development or commercialization
programs based on clinical trial results, changes in their strategic focus due to the
acquisition of competitive drugs, availability of funding, or other external factors,
such as a business combination that diverts resources or creates competing
priorities;

collaborators may delay clinical trials, provide insufficient funding for a clinical
trial, stop a clinical trial, abandon a drug candidate, repeat or conduct new clinical
trials, or require a new formulation of a drug candidate for clinical testing;

collaborators could independently develop, or develop with third parties, drugs that
compete directly or indirectly with our drug candidates;

a collaborator with marketing and distribution rights to one or more of our drug
candidates may not commit sufficient resources to their marketing and distribution;

collaborators may not properly obtain, protect, maintain, defend or enforce our
intellectual property rights or may use our intellectual property or proprietary
information in a way that gives rise to actual or threatened litigation that could
jeopardize or invalidate our intellectual property or proprietary information or
expose us to potential liability;

disputes may arise between us and a collaborator that cause the delay or termination
of the research, development or commercialization of our drug candidates, or that
result
in costly litigation or arbitration that diverts management attention and
resources;

collaborations may be terminated and,

collaborators may own or co-own intellectual property covering our drug candidates
that results from our collaborating with them, and in such cases, we would not have
the exclusive right to commercialize such intellectual property; and,

we co-own with others, and therefore do not have complete control over, some of our
intellectual property and, in the normal course of business, we have licensed and
may in the future license our rights under such co-owned intellectual property to
third parties, which may lead to disputes with the relevant co-owner of such
intellectual property.
