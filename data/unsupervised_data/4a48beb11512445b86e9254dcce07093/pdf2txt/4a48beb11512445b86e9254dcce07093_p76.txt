or denial of regulatory approval by the NMPA, FDA, EMA or other comparable regulatory
authority, or could result in limitations or withdrawal following approvals. If results of our
trials reveal a high and unacceptable severity or prevalence of adverse events, our trials could
be suspended or terminated and the NMPA, FDA, EMA or other comparable regulatory
authorities could order us to cease further development of, or deny approval of, our drug
candidates.

Numerous drug-related adverse events and serious adverse events have been reported in
our clinical trials. Drug-related adverse events or serious adverse events could affect patient
recruitment or the ability of enrolled subjects to complete the trial, and could result in potential
product liability claims. Any of these occurrences may harm our reputation, business, financial
condition and prospects significantly.

Additionally, adverse events caused by our drug candidates, or caused by our drug
candidates when used in combination with other drugs, could potentially cause significant
negative consequences for our Company, including:

regulatory authorities could delay or halt pending clinical trials;

we may suspend, delay or alter development or marketing of the drug candidate;

regulatory authorities may withdraw approvals or revoke licenses of an approved
drug candidate, or we may determine to do so even if not required;

regulatory authorities may require additional warnings on the label;

we may be required to develop a risk evaluation mitigation strategy for the drug
candidate, or, if one is already in place, to incorporate additional requirements under
the risk evaluation mitigation strategy, or to develop a similar strategy as required
by a comparable regulatory authority;

we may be required to conduct post-market studies; and

we could be sued and held liable for harm caused to subjects or patients.

Any of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance
of the particular drug candidate, and could significantly harm our business, results of
operations and prospects.

Any of our future approved drug candidates will be subject
to ongoing or additional
regulatory obligations and continued regulatory review, which may result in significant
additional expense and we may be subject to penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory
requirements or experience unanticipated problems with our drug candidates.
