SUMMARY OF THE CONSTITUTION OF THE
COMPANY AND CAYMAN COMPANIES LAW

(f) Disclosure of interest in contracts with the Company or any of its subsidiaries

No Director or proposed Director shall be disqualified by his office from contracting
with the Company either as vendor, purchaser or otherwise nor shall any such contract or
any contract or arrangement entered into by or on behalf of the Company with any person,
company or partnership of or in which any Director shall be a member or otherwise
interested be capable on that account of being avoided, nor shall any Director so
contracting or being any member or so interested be liable to account to the Company for
any profit so realised by any such contract or arrangement by reason only of such Director
holding that office or the fiduciary relationship thereby established, provided that such
Director shall, if his interest in such contract or arrangement is material, declare the
nature of his interest at the earliest meeting of the board of Directors at which it is
practicable for him to do so, either specifically or by way of a general notice stating that,
by reason of the facts specified in the notice, he is to be regarded as interested in any
contracts of a specified description which may be made by the Company.

A Director shall not be entitled to vote on (nor shall be counted in the quorum in
relation to) any resolution of the Directors in respect of any contract or arrangement or
any other proposal in which the Director or any of his close associates (or, if required by
the Listing Rules, his other associates) has any material interest, and if he shall do so his
vote shall not be counted (nor is he to be counted in the quorum for the resolution), but
this prohibition shall not apply to any of the following matters, namely:

(i)

(ii)

the giving to such Director or any of his close associates of any security or
indemnity in respect of money lent or obligations incurred or undertaken by
him or any of them at the request of or for the benefit of the Company or any
of its subsidiaries;

the giving of any security or indemnity to a third party in respect of a debt or
obligation of the Company or any of its subsidiaries for which the Director or
any of his close associates has himself/themselves assumed responsibility in
whole or in part and whether alone or jointly under a guarantee or indemnity
or by the giving of security;

(iii) any proposal concerning an offer of shares, debentures or other securities of or
by the Company or any other company which the Company may promote or be
interested in for subscription or purchase where the Director or any of his close
associates is/are or is/are to be interested as a participant in the underwriting
or sub-underwriting of the offer;

(iv) any proposal or arrangement concerning the benefit of employees of the

Company or any of its subsidiaries including:
