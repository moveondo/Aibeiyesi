the number and characteristics of drug candidates that we may in-license and
develop;

the amount and timing of the milestone and royalty payments we receive from or pay
to our collaborators;

the cost of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims or other
intellectual property rights;

selling and marketing costs associated with any future drug candidates that may be
approved, including the cost and timing of expanding our marketing and sales

the terms and timing of any potential future collaborations,
arrangements that we may establish;

licensing or other

pipeline drug candidates;

the cost and timing of development and completion of commercial-scale internal or
