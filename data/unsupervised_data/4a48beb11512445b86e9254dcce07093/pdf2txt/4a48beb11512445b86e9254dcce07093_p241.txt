Another measure of the improvement in immune status induced by PD-1 blockage is the
shrinkage of tumors in animal models. In our case, mice studies we conducted using the H292
humanized Winn mouse model. As illustrated in the following diagram, sintilimab was shown
to
in
immunocompromised mice that are injected with human NSCLC cells. Notably, at the highest
dose level of 10 mg/kg which is the standard dose level for nivolumab,
treatment with
sintilimab led to complete regression of tumors.

PD-1 antibodies function by binding to PD-1 on the surface of T lymphocytes and
blocking PD-1 binding to PD-L1 and PD-L2 on the surface of cancer cells. The binding of PD-1
antibodies to PD-1 is called receptor occupancy and is a measure of the fraction of PD-1 that
is blocked on the surface of T lymphocytes which can be measured using standard flow
cytometry methodology. A higher fraction of occupied receptor for a longer period of time may
potentially result in better clinical efficacy. We compared the receptor occupancy of PD-1 in
patients during and after they are given sintilimab to the published receptor occupancy for
nivolumab. As shown in the left panel of the following figure, sintilimab had greater than 95%
receptor occupancy for the full duration of a cycle of therapy at the 3 mg/kg dose level. In
comparison, published data show that, at the same 3 mg/kg dose level, nivolumab (indicated
in the figure by its former name MDX-1106) had a receptor occupancy that falls within the
range of approximately 75% to 80% throughout the cycle of therapy, as shown in the right
panel of the following figure.
