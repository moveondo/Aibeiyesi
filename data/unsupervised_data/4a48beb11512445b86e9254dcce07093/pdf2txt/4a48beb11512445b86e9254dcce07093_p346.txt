LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Management monitors and maintains a level of cash and cash equivalents deemed
adequate to finance our operations and mitigate the effects of fluctuations in cash flows. In
addition, management monitors the utilization of borrowings and, from time to time, evaluate
the options to renew the borrowings upon expiry based on our actual business requirement. We
rely on bank borrowings and equity financing as the major sources of liquidity.

Since inception, we have incurred negative cash flows from our operations. Substantially
all of our operating cash outflows have resulted from our research and development expenses
and administrative expenses associated with our operations. Our operating activities used
RMB363.0 million, RMB492.3 million and RMB342.5 million for the years ended December
31, 2016 and 2017 and the six months ended June 30, 2018, respectively.

As of June 30, 2018, we had cash and cash equivalents and other financial assets of

RMB2,068.5 million.
