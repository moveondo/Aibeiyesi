The audited consolidated net tangible liabilities of the Group attributable to owners of the Company as
at 30 June 2018 is extracted from the consolidated statements of financial position set out in Appendix
I to this prospectus.

The estimated net proceeds from the Global Offering are based on 236,350,000 Shares at the Global
Offering of HK$12.50 (equivalent to RMB11.02) and HK$14.00 (equivalent to RMB12.34) per offer
share, being the low-end and high-end of the stated offer price range, respectively, after deduction of
the estimated underwriting fees and commissions and other related expenses paid/payable by the Group
(excluding listing expenses charged to profit or loss prior to 30 June 2018) and without taking into
account of any shares (i) which may be allotted and issued upon the exercise of the Over-allotment
Option or (ii) which may be issued under Pre-IPO Share Incentive Plan or the Post-IPO ESOP or (iii)
which may be allotted and issued or repurchased by our Company under the general mandates for the
allotment and issue or repurchase of shares granted to the directors of the Company.

For the purpose of the estimated net proceeds from the Global Offering, the amount denominated in HK$
has been converted into RMB at the rate of HK$1 to RMB0.8817, which was the exchange rate
prevailing on 9 October 2018 with reference to the rate published by the People’s Bank of China. No
representation is made that the HK$ amounts have been, could have been or may be converted to RMB,
or vice versa, at that rate or any other rates or at all.

The unaudited pro forma adjusted consolidated net tangible assets of the Group per Share is arrived at
on the basis that 442,606,893 Shares were in issue (retrospectively adjusted for share subdivision as
disclosed in Appendix I to the Prospectus) assuming that the Global Offering had been completed on 30
June 2018 and without taking into account of any shares (i) which may be allotted and issued upon the
exercise of the Over-allotment Option or (ii) which may be issued under Pre-IPO Share Incentive Plan
or the Post-IPO ESOP or (iii) which may be allotted and issued or repurchased by our Company under
the general mandates for the allotment and issue or repurchase of shares granted to the directors of the
Company or (iv) the conversion of the Preferred Shares or (v) any unvested restricted shares.

For the purpose of unaudited pro forma adjusted consolidated net tangible assets of the Group per Share,
the amount stated in RMB is converted into Hong Kong dollar at the rate of HK$1 to RMB0.8817, which
was the exchange rate prevailing on 9 October 2018 with reference to the rate published by the People’s
Bank of China. No representation is made that the RMB amounts have been, could have been or may
be converted to Hong Kong dollars, or vice versa, at that rate or at all.

No adjustment has been made to the unaudited pro forma adjusted consolidated net tangible assets of
the Group as at 30 June 2018 to reflect any trading result or other transaction of the Group entered into
subsequent to 30 June 2018. In particular, the unaudited pro forma adjusted consolidated net tangible
assets of the Group attributable to owners of the Company as shown on II-1 have not been adjusted to
illustrate the effect of the conversion of Preferred Shares into ordinary shares. The conversion of
Preferred Shares upon completion of IPO would then have reclassified the RMB3,550,116,000 Preferred
Shares to equity. The conversion of Preferred Shares would have increased the total share in issue
assumption stated in note 3 by 671,783,410 shares to a total of 1,114,390,303 shares in issue. The
adjustment to the unaudited pro forma adjusted consolidated net tangible assets of the Group after
conversion of Preferred Shares would be as follows:
