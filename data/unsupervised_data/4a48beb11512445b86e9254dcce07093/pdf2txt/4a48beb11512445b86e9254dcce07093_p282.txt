Cell based activity of IBI-302 compared with standards

We also assessed IBI-302 in a Mouse Choroidal Neovascularization model (the Mouse
CNV model). Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) is a non-specific response to specific
damage of Bruch’s membrane (the middle layer of the retina) and is the pathobiology behind
wet and dry AMD. The results of the study indicated that IBI-302 was more potent than each
of VEGF Inhibitory Domain (VID) and Complement Inhibitory Domain (CID) alone in
blocking murine CNV and in reducing both the concentration of VEGF and the concentration
of complement proteins. These results indicate an additive effect for VID and CID and
demonstrate that IBI-302 is capable of blocking both the complement and the angiogenesis (the
growth of blood vessels) pathways in the eye.

In the following figure,

the green fluorescent circular lesions represent

the MACs
(membrane attack complexes) that form in the retina of mice as a result of laser-induced
activation of the complement system, and treatment with IBI-302 decreased the dimensions of
the MAC more significantly, indicating stronger efficacy, as compared to treatment with either
VID or CID alone or to treatment with PBS (phosphate buffer saline) which is used as a
control.

Abbreviations: MAC = membrane attack complex; PBS = phosphate buffer saline;

VID = VEGF inhibitory domain; CID = complement inhibitory domain.
