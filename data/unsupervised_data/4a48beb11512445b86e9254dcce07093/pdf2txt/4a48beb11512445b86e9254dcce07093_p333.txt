Other Income

Other income consists of bank interest income and government grants income.

Bank Interest Income

Bank interest income increased by RMB3.5 million to RMB8.0 million for the year ended
December 31, 2017, from RMB4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase
in bank interest income was primarily attributable to an increase in cash balance close to the
end of 2016 as a result of the deposit of the proceeds from the Series D equity financing, which
led to a higher average cash balance in 2017 compared to 2016. Bank interest income increased
by RMB2.2 million to RMB6.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018, from RMB3.9
million for the six months ended June 30, 2017, primarily attributable to the interest income
earned on the proceeds of our series E financing in the first half of 2018.

Government Grants Income

Government grants consist of (i) government subsidies specifically for the capital
expenditure related to the purchase of plant and machinery, which is recognized over the useful
life of related assets, and (ii) incentive and other subsidies for research and development
activities and interest subsidies, which are recognized upon the fulfillment of certain
conditions set by the government.

Some of the government grants we received related to costs expected to be incurred in the
future and were revocable if we failed to satisfy the conditions specified under such
government grants. These government grants were recognized as income upon the satisfaction
of such conditions.
