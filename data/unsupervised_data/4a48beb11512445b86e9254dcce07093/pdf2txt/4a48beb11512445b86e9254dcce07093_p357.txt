The unaudited pro forma adjusted consolidated net tangible assets of the Group per Share is arrived at
on the basis that 442,606,893 Shares were in issue (retrospectively adjusted for share subdivision as
disclosed in Appendix I to the Prospectus) assuming that the Global Offering had been completed on
June 30, 2018 and without taking into account of any shares (i) which may be allotted and issued upon
the exercise of the Over-allotment Option or (ii) which may be issued under Pre-IPO Share Incentive
Plan or the Post-IPO ESOP or (iii) which may be allotted and issued or repurchased by our Company
under the general mandates for the allotment and issue or repurchase of shares granted to the directors
of our Company or (iv) the conversion of the Preferred Shares or (v) any unvested restricted shares.

For the purpose of unaudited pro forma adjusted consolidated net tangible assets of our Group per share,
the amount stated in RMB is converted into Hong Kong dollar at the rate of HK$1 to RMB0.8817, which
was the exchange rate prevailing on October 9, 2018 with reference to the rate published by the People’s
Bank of China. No representation is made that the RMB amounts have been, could have been or may
be converted to Hong Kong dollars, or vice versa, at that rate or at all.

No adjustment has been made to the unaudited pro forma adjusted consolidated net tangible assets of
our Group as at June 30, 2018 to reflect any trading result or other transaction of our Group entered into
subsequent to June 30, 2018. In particular, the unaudited pro forma adjusted consolidated net tangible
assets of our Group attributable to our owners as shown on II-1 have not been adjusted to illustrate the
effect of the conversion of preferred shares into ordinary shares. The conversion of Preferred Shares
upon completion of IPO would then have reclassified the RMB3,550,116,000 Preferred Shares to equity.
The conversion of preferred shares would have increased the total share in issue assumption stated in
note 3 by 671,783,410 shares to a total of 1,114,390,303 shares in issue. The adjustment to the unaudited
pro forma adjusted consolidated net tangible assets of our Group after conversion of Preferred Shares
would be as follows:
