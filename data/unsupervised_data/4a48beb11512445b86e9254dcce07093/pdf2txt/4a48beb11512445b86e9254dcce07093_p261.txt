Notes:

CD20 mAbs can induce tumor killing in several ways.

E.

Direct binding of CD20 mAbs initiates the crosslinking of multiple CD20 molecules, resulting in cell-death
via induction of non-classical apoptosis;

Activation of complement results in complement-dependent cytotoxicity;

Recognition of opsonized tumor cells by Fc␥Rs expressed on immune effector cells initiates antibody-
dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity;

Fc␥R may only serve as crosslinking platform and thereby enhance antigen signaling in the tumor cells;

Ab-initiated complement activation yields to deposition of complement cleavage fragments, which may
enhance tumor killing through recognition by complement receptors (CRs) in a process called complement-
enhanced ADCC.

Market Opportunities and Competition

Originally developed by Roche and Genentech, and first approved for marketing in 1997,
rituximab is used for treatment of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia,
rheumatoid arthritis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura,
pemphigus vulgaris and myasthenia gravis. Rituxan reached US$7.5 billion in worldwide sales
in 2017, according to the Frost & Sullivan Report.

According to Frost & Sullivan Report, there were 81,800 new cases of non-Hodgkin’s
lymphoma in China in 2017, and the incidence is expect to increase to 90,100 in 2022. These
