APPENDIX III

SUMMARY OF THE CONSTITUTION OF THE
COMPANY AND CAYMAN COMPANIES LAW

13 Mergers and Consolidations

The Companies Law permits mergers and consolidations between Cayman Islands
companies and between Cayman Islands companies and non-Cayman Islands companies. For
these purposes, (a) “merger” means the merging of two or more constituent companies and the
vesting of their undertaking, property and liabilities in one of such companies as the surviving
company, and (b) “consolidation” means the combination of
two or more constituent
companies into a consolidated company and the vesting of the undertaking, property and
liabilities of such companies to the consolidated company. In order to effect such a merger or
consolidation, the directors of each constituent company must approve a written plan of merger
or consolidation, which must then be authorised by (a) a special resolution of each constituent
company and (b) such other authorisation, if any, as may be specified in such constituent
company’s articles of association. The written plan of merger or consolidation must be filed
with the Registrar of Companies of the Cayman Islands together with a declaration as to the
solvency of the consolidated or surviving company, a list of the assets and liabilities of each
constituent company and an undertaking that a copy of
the certificate of merger or
consolidation will be given to the members and creditors of each constituent company and that
notification of the merger or consolidation will be published in the Cayman Islands Gazette.
Dissenting shareholders have the right to be paid the fair value of their shares (which, if not
agreed between the parties, will be determined by the Cayman Islands court) if they follow the
required procedures, subject to certain exceptions. Court approval is not required for a merger
or consolidation which is effected in compliance with these statutory procedures.

14 Reconstructions

There are statutory provisions which facilitate reconstructions and amalgamations
approved by a majority in number representing 75% in value of shareholders or creditors,
depending on the circumstances, as are present at a meeting called for such purpose and
thereafter sanctioned by the Grand Court of
the Cayman Islands. Whilst a dissenting
shareholder would have the right to express to the Grand Court his view that the transaction
for which approval is sought would not provide the shareholders with a fair value for their
shares, the Grand Court is unlikely to disapprove the transaction on that ground alone in the
absence of evidence of fraud or bad faith on behalf of management and if the transaction were
approved and consummated the dissenting shareholder would have no rights comparable to the
appraisal rights (i.e. the right to receive payment in cash for the judicially determined value of
his shares) ordinarily available, for example,
to dissenting shareholders of United States
corporations.
