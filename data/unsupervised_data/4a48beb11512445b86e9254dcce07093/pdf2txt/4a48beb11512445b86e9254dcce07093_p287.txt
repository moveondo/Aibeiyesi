phagocytosis of tumor cells and stimulating T cells activation. Anti-CD47 antibodies tend to
attack normal cells. However, IBI-322 molecules preferentially distribute to PD-L1 positive
tumor cells and thereby reduce this potential on-target side effect associated with mono-
specific anti-CD47 antibodies. Our pre-clinical data show that IBI-322 has promising in vivo
efficacy,
tumor-enriched distribution and better safety than a mono-specific anti-CD47
antibody.

The diagram below shows that IBI-322, a bi-specific antibody that contains a binding site
for CD47 and a different binding site for PD-L1, has a dual mechanism of action-stimulation
of macrophages and blockade of the PD-1 T-cell checkpoint. Macrophages are phagocytes
(cells that “eat other cells and pathogens”). CD47 is a protein on the surface of many normal
cells that signals to the macrophage: “Don’t eat me”. The signaling protein on the surface of
the macrophage that interacts with CD47 is SIRP␣. Tumors often express high levels of CD47
to inhibit macrophage phagocytosis. Also, tumors frequently express high levels of PD-L1, a
protein that binds to the checkpoint receptor, PD-1, on surface of T-cell. This binding turns off
the ability of a T-cell to kill PD-L1 expressing tumor cells. As is seen in the top panel of the
following diagram, tumor cells that express both PD-L1 and CD47 are able to block two
different pathways that would normally kill tumor cells. Normal erythrocytes also express
CD47 so that high potency binding of an anti-CD47 antibody will cause the macrophage to
ingest erythrocytes. The erythrocyte phagocytosis causes significant anemia. IBI-322 has a
finely tuned affinity for CD47 and also has the PD-L1 binding component to only target tumor
cells that express both PD-L1 and CD47. The bi-specific nature of IBI-322 and the careful
tuning of the affinity allow the antibody to spare the erythrocytes which do not express PD-L1.
