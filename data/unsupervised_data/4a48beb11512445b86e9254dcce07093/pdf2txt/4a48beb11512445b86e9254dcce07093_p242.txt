Receptor occupancy in patients after a single dose of anti-PD-1 antibodies

In addition to achieving a higher level of PD-1 receptor occupancy, sintilimab also proved
to be able to maintain that level for a long period of time. Indeed, in Hodgkin’s lymphoma
patients given multiple cycles of sintilimab at 200 mg flat dose level, the PD-1 receptor
occupancy in peripheral blood lymphocytes is greater than 95% for at least 180 days, as shown
in the graph below.

Abbreviations: PD-1 RO = PD-1 receptor occupancy; IV = intravenous.

Safety profile consistent with pembrolizumab with no unexpected adverse events

Longer and more robust

receptor occupancy prolongs PD-1 blockade in patient
lymphocytes and could allow for stronger efficacy. One concern could be that better PD-1
blockade could result
in a higher frequency and intensity of adverse events in patients.
