WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ULTIMATELY DEVELOP AND MARKET IBI-306
SUCCESSFULLY.

IBI-310

IBI-310 is a fully human monoclonal anti-CTLA-4 antibody drug candidate that we are
evaluating for treatment of a variety of cancers in China as a monotherapy and potentially in
combination with anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibodies, including sintilimab. IBI-310 has the same
DNA sequence as ipilimumab (sold under the trade name Yervoy). Ipilimumab has not been
approved for marketing in China and we are developing IBI-310 under the novel drug pathway
according to the NMPA regulations. We have developed our proprietary cell line for IBI-310.

Mechanism of Action

IBI-310 specifically targets an immune checkpoint called cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-
associated protein 4 (CTLA-4), which down-regulates T-cell immune response to cancer cells
in a separate pathway from the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway. IBI-310 binds to CTLA-4 to remove the
blockade and reactivate the immune response.

Market Opportunity and Competition

Yervoy has been approved as a monotherapy and as part of a combination therapy in

melanoma and renal cell carcinoma in the U.S. It is still in clinical development in China.

According to the Frost & Sullivan Report, Yervoy achieved sales of US$1.2 billion
worldwide in 2017. CTLA-4 is an important pathway for a number of diseases. BMS is
conducting numerous clinical trials of Yervoy in the U.S. both as a monotherapy and in
combination with other therapies such as nivolumab.
