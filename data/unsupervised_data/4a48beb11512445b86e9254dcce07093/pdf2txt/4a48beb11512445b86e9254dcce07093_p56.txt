GLOSSARY OF TECHNICAL TERMS

“plasmacytoid dendritic cells”

a rare type of immune cell that are known to secrete large
quantities of type 1 interferon (IFNs) in response to a
viral infection. They circulate in the blood and are found
in peripheral lymphoid organs

“PR”

partial response or partial response rate

“pre-clinical study(ies)”

pre-clinical studies testing a drug on non-human subjects,
to gather efficacy, toxicity, pharmacokinetic and safety
information and to decide whether the drug is ready for
clinical trials

“progression free survival” or

“PFS”

“psoriasis”

“psoriatic arthritis”

the length of time during and after the treatment of a
lives with the

“RANKL”

Receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-〉 ligand

“receptor occupancy” or “RO”

the binding of PD-1 antibodies to PD-1, which is a
measure of the fraction of PD-1 that is blocked on the
surface of T lymphocytes. By repeatedly measuring the
receptor occupancy over time, the duration of receptor
blockade can be directly observed. A higher fraction of
occupied receptor for a longer period of time could result
in better clinical efficacy
