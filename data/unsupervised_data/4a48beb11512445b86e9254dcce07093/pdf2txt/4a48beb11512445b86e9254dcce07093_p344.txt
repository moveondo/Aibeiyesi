Other payables primarily consist of payables to utility suppliers and general administrative service
providers.

Our other payables and accrued expenses increased by RMB67.5 million from RMB55.0
million as of December 31, 2016 to RMB122.5 million as of December 31, 2017. The increase
was primarily attributable to the increase in research and development expenses, the increase
in payables relating to the construction of our manufacturing facility, and the increase in
payroll payables as our headcount expanded in line with our overall business expansion. Our
other payables and accrued expenses increased by RMB1,601.0 million to RMB1,723.5 million
as of June 30, 2018, from RMB122.5 million as of December 31, 2017, primarily due to a
RMB1,504.0 million of consideration payable for acquiring non-controlling interest of a
subsidiary as part of our restructuring process. As of August 31, 2018, we have fully paid such
consideration payable and acquired non-controlling interest of the subsidiary, leading to the
significant decrease of our other payables and accrued expenses from June 30, 2018 to August
31, 2018.
