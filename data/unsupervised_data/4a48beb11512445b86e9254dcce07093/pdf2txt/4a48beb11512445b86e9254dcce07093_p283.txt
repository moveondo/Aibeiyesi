The following figure shows that, in the same study using the Mouse CNV model, IBI-302
reduces both the concentration of VEGF and the concentration of C3a (a part of the
complement protein system known as complement component 3) to a greater extent than each
of PBS, VID and CID does.

IBI-302 results in greater reduction of the intraocular concentration of

VEGF and complement proteins

Reduction of VEGF concentration

Reduction of C3a concentration

Abbreviations: PBS = phosphate buffer saline; VID = VEGF inhibitory domain; CID = complement inhibitory

domain; C3a = a complement peptide formed by the cleavage of complement component 3.

Better efficacy at lower dose level than bevacizumab

We assessed the efficacy of IBI-302 in the Rhesus Monkey Choroidal Neovascularization
(CNV) model. Based on the study as shown in the figure below, IBI-302 at a 0.25 mg/eye dose
level shows better efficacy than bevacizumab at a 1.25 mg/eye dose level. In this study, the
retina of a monkey is damaged with a laser. The retina responds by activation of the
complement cascade and the proliferation of endothelial cells, which induces inflammation,
angiogenesis and proteolysis. These reactions create the white circular lesions in the retinal
photos above. Treatment of the monkey by intraocular injection of IBI-302 or bevacizumab (a
VEGF antibody) decreases CNV and IBI-302 is more potent in blocking laser induced CNV
than bevacizumab.
