FINANCIAL INFORMATION

Currency Risk

Certain bank balances and cash, trade and other payables, and other financial liabilities
are denominated in foreign currencies of respective group entities which are exposed to foreign
currency risk. We did not use any derivative contracts to hedge against our exposure to
currency risk during the Track Record Period and up to the Latest Practicable Date. However,
the management monitors foreign exchange exposure and will consider hedging significant
foreign currency exposure should the need arise. For details, including relevant sensitivity
analysis, see note 37b to the Accountants’ Report set out in Appendix I.

Liquidity Risk

To manage our liquidity risk, we monitor and maintain a level of cash and cash
equivalents deemed adequate by our management to finance our operations and mitigate the
effects of fluctuations in cash flows. For details, see note 37b to Accountants’ Report set out
in Appendix I.
