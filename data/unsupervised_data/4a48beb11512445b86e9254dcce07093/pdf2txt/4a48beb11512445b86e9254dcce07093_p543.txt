APPENDIX IV

STATUTORY AND GENERAL INFORMATION

publication of an announcement of a listed company’s results for any year or half-year
under the Listing Rules, or quarterly or any other interim period (whether or not required
under the Listing Rules), the listed company may not repurchase its shares on the Stock
Exchange other than in exceptional circumstances. In addition, the Stock Exchange may
prohibit a repurchase of securities on the Stock Exchange if a listed company has
breached the Listing Rules.

(vi) Reporting Requirements

Certain information relating to repurchases of securities on the Stock Exchange or
otherwise must be reported to the Stock Exchange not later than 30 minutes before the
earlier of the commencement of the morning trading session or any pre-opening session
on the following business day. In addition, a listed company’s annual report is required
to disclose details regarding repurchases of securities made during the year, including a
monthly analysis of the number of securities repurchased, the purchase price per share or
the highest and lowest price paid for all such repurchases, where relevant, and the
aggregate prices paid.

(vii) Core Connected Persons

The Listing Rules prohibit a company from knowingly purchasing securities on the
Stock Exchange from a “core connected person”, that is, a director, chief executive or
substantial shareholder of the company or any of its subsidiaries or a close associate of
any of them (as defined in the Listing Rules) and a core connected person shall not
knowingly sell his securities to the company.

(b) Reasons for Repurchases

Our Directors believe that it is in the best interests of our Company and Shareholders for
our Directors to have a general authority from the Shareholders to enable our Company to
repurchase Shares in the market. Such repurchases may, depending on market conditions and
funding arrangements at the time, lead to an enhancement of the net asset value per Share
and/or earnings per Share and will only be made where our Directors believe that such
repurchases will benefit our Company and Shareholders.

(c) Funding of Repurchases

Repurchase of the Shares must be funded out of funds legally available for such purpose
in accordance with the Articles of Association and the applicable laws of the Cayman Islands.
Our Directors may not repurchase the Shares on the Stock Exchange for a consideration other
than cash or for settlement otherwise than in accordance with the trading rules of the Stock
Exchange. Subject to the foregoing, our Directors may make repurchases with profits of the
Company or out of a new issuance of shares made for the purpose of the repurchase or, if
authorised by the Articles of Association and subject to the Cayman Companies Law, out of
capital and, in the case of any premium payable on the repurchase, out of profits of our
Company or from sums standing to the credit of the share premium account of our Company
or, if authorised by the Articles of Association and subject to Cayman Companies Law, out of
capital.
