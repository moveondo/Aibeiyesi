FINANCIAL INFORMATION

Contract Assets

A contract asset is recognized over the period in which research and development services
are performed and represents our right
to consideration for the services transferred to a
customer to date. A contract asset is reclassified as trade receivables at the point when it is
invoiced to the customer. We did not recognize any contract assets as of December 31, 2016
and 2017, and we recognized contract assets of RMB3.5 million as of June 30, 2018 from our
research and development contract with a biopharmaceutical company in China. As of August
31, 2018, none of these contract assets has been billed to customers subsequent to June 30,
2018 and we expect to fulfill the performance obligations and receive milestone payment in
late September 2018.

Trade Payables

The trade payables arise from our purchase of raw materials and third-party contracting
services. The trade payables increased by RMB13.6 million to RMB34.8 million as of
December 31, 2017 from RMB21.2 million as of December 31, 2016. Trade payables increased
by RMB1.8 million to RMB36.6 million as of June 30, 2018, from RMB34.8 million as of
December 31, 2017. The increases were primarily attributable to more service fees payable to
our third party service providers. Our credit terms on trade payables were up to 60 days. The
average days payable outstanding in 2016 and 2017 are 24 days and 25 days, respectively. We
have not been delinquent in repayment of our trade payables.
