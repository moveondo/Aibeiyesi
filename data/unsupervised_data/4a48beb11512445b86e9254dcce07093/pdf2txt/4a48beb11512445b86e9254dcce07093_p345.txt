FINANCIAL INFORMATION

Contract Liabilities

Contract liabilities include (i) payments we have received in advance in connection with
our research and development services and (ii) payments we have received in advance in
connection with the license to commercialize.

Contract liabilities arise when the payment we received from a customer in connection
with the research and development services we provide to such customer exceeds the revenue
recognized to date under the cost-based input method.

Payments we received in advance in connection with the commercialization license will
be recognized as revenue over the commercialization period. With respect to the Lilly China
Agreement, the commercialization period is expected to commence beginning 2019.

The contract liabilities relating to amounts we received in advance in connection with
research and development services increased to RMB0.9 million as of December 31, 2017 from
zero as of December 31, 2016 which was primarily attributable to the payment we received for
the research and development services we provided to a biopharmaceutical company in China.
In the first half of 2018, we provided services to settle the previous balance and recognized
RMB0.9 million as our revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2018. As of June 30, 2018,
we did not have any contract liabilities relating to amounts received in advance of delivery for
research and development services.

The contract liabilities relating to amounts we received in advance in connection with the
license to commercialize increased by RMB56.6 million to RMB348.8 million as of December
31, 2017 from RMB292.2 million as of December 31, 2016. The contract liabilities relating to
amounts we received in advance in connection with the license to commercialize increased by
RMB94.6 million to RMB443.4 million as of June 30, 2018, from RMB348.8 million as of
December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to (i) the payments we received
from Eli Lilly in 2017 and the first half of 2018 pursuant to the Lilly China Agreement and (ii)
the interest arising from the aggregate balance of the payments we have received from Eli Lilly
representing the financing component of the contract with Eli Lilly. See the section headed
“Business – Collaboration Agreements – Collaboration with Eli Lilly” for more information
about the Lilly China Agreement.
