WAIVERS FROM COMPLIANCE WITH THE LISTING RULES AND EXEMPTIONS FROM

THE COMPANIES (WINDING UP AND MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS) ORDINANCE

Accordingly, we applied to the SFC for, and the SFC has granted, a certificate of
exemption from strict compliance with the requirements under paragraph 27 of Part I and
paragraph 31 of Part
the Third Schedule to the Companies (Winding Up and
Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance on the following grounds:

II of

(a)

(b)

(c)

(d)

(e)

our Company is primarily engaged in the research and development, application and
commercialisation of biotech products, and falls within the scope of biotech
company as defined under Chapter 18A of the Listing Rules;

the Accountant’s Report for each of the two financial years ended December 31,
2016 and 2017, and the six months ended June 30, 2018 has been prepared and is
set out in Appendix I to this prospectus in accordance with Rule 18A.06 of the
Listing Rules;

as of the Latest Practicable Date, we had not commercialized any products and
therefore did not generate any revenue from product sales. The details of our major
activities have been fully disclosed in the section headed “Business” in the
Prospectus;

notwithstanding that the financial results set out in this prospectus are only for the
two years ended December 31, 2016 and 2017, and the six months ended June 30,
2018 in accordance with Chapter 18A of the Listing Rules, other information
required to be disclosed under the Listing Rules and requirements under the
Companies (Winding up and Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance has been
adequately disclosed in this prospectus pursuant to the relevant requirements; and

given that the Company is only required to disclose its financial results for each of
the two financial years ended December 31, 2016 and 2017 under Chapter 18A of
the Listing Rules and the six months ended June 30, 2018 and preparation of the
financial results for the year ended December 31, 2018 would require additional
work to be performed by the Company and its auditors, it will be unduly burdensome
for the Company to comply with the relevant requirements under the Companies
(Winding Up and Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance as stated above.

Our Company is of the view that the Accountant’s Report covering the two years ended
December 31, 2016 and 2017, and the six months ended June 30, 2018, together with other
disclosure in this prospectus, has already provided the potential investors with adequate and
reasonably up-to-date information in the circumstances to form a view on the track record of
our Company; and our Directors confirm that all information which is necessary for the
investing public to make an informed assessment of the business, assets and liabilities,
financial position, management and prospects has been included in this prospectus. Therefore,
the exemption would not prejudice the interests of the investing public.
