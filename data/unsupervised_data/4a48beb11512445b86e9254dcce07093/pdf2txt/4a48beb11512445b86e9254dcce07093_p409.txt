STRUCTURE OF THE GLOBAL OFFERING

of the number of Shares initially available for subscription under the Hong Kong Public
Offering, the Joint Global Coordinators have the authority to reallocate International Offer
Shares originally included in the International Offering to the Hong Kong Public Offering in
such number as they deem appropriate, provided that in accordance with Guidance Letter
HKEX-GL91-18 issued by the Stock Exchange, (i) the number of International Offer Shares
reallocated to the Hong Kong Public Offering should not exceed 23,635,000 Shares,
representing 10% of the Offer Shares initially available under the Global Offering, increasing
the total number of Offer Shares available under the Hong Kong Public Offering to 47,270,000
Shares; and (ii) the final Offer Price should be fixed at the bottom end of the indicative Offer
Price range (i.e. HK$12.50 per Offer Share) stated in this prospectus.

In each case, the additional Offer Shares reallocated to the Hong Kong Public Offering
will be allocated between pool A and pool B and the number of Offer Shares allocated to the
International Offering will be correspondingly reduced in such manner as the Joint Global
Coordinators deem appropriate.

Details of any reallocation of Offer Shares between the Hong Kong Public Offering and
the International Offering will be disclosed in the results announcement of the Global Offering,
which is expected to be published on Tuesday, October 30, 2018.

Applications

Each applicant under the Hong Kong Public Offering will be required to give an
undertaking and confirmation in the application submitted by him that he and any person(s) for
whose benefit he is making the application has not applied for or taken up, or indicated an
interest for, and will not apply for or take up, or indicate an interest for, any International
Offering Shares under the International Offering. Such applicant’s application is liable to be
rejected if such undertaking and/or confirmation is/are breached and/or untrue (as the case may
be) or if he has been or will be placed or allocated International Offering Shares under the
International Offering.

Applicants under the Hong Kong Public Offering are required to pay, on application, the
Maximum Offer Price of HK$14.00 per Offer Share in addition to the brokerage, the SFC
transaction levy and the Stock Exchange trading fee payable on each Offer Share, amounting
to a total of HK$7,070.54 for one board lot of 500 Shares. If the Offer Price, as finally
determined in the manner described in the sub-section headed “Pricing and Allocation” in this
section below, is less than the Maximum Offer Price of HK$14.00 per Offer Share, appropriate
refund payments (including the brokerage, the SFC transaction levy and the Stock Exchange
trading fee attributable to the surplus application monies) will be made to successful
applicants, without interest. Further details are set out in the section headed “How to Apply for
Hong Kong Offer Shares” in this prospectus.
