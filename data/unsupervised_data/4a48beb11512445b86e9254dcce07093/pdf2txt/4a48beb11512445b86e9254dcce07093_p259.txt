The PK profiles of IBI-305 and bevacizumab (Avastin) in

normal volunteers are bioequivalent

Note: The inset is a log transformation of the PK data to better illustrate the lower ranges of antibody

concentration.

Step 4: Clinical Confirmation Studies

We are conducting a randomized, double blind, multi-center, Phase 3 study in China to
evaluate the efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of IBI-305 in combination with chemotherapy
compared to bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy in patients with advanced or
recurrent non-squamous non-small cell
(non-squamous-NSCLC). The study
randomizes 436 patients at a 1:1 ratio to two treatment arms. The primary endpoint of this
study is objective response rate. As of June 7, 2018, we opened 42 trial sites and completed
patient enrollment. We recruited a total of 450 patients, exceeding our planned 436 patients.
Based on internal review of the progress of this trial and preliminary clinical observations, we
expect to complete this trial and, if the data successfully demonstrated biosimilarity, to have
a pre-NDA meeting with, and submit an NDA to, the NMPA in the first quarter of 2019.

We have not seen unexpected adverse events with IBI-305 in this trial. The aggregate
safety data for this trial cannot be disclosed at the date of this prospectus because the trial is
double blind and has not been unblinded yet and the trial data base has not been locked. The
trial data base is expected to be locked on October 30, 2018. The blinded analysis of the interim
trial data shows that the safety profile of IBI-305 is consistent with the reported safety profile
for Avastin. We expect the safety data for IBI-305 to become available for disclosure in the first
quarter of 2019 and we will promptly disclose such data by way of announcement on the Stock
Exchange.
