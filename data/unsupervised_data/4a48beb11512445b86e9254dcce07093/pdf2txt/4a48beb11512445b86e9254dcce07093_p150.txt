Monoclonal Antibodies

Monoclonal antibodies, including mono-specifics and bi-specifics, and fusion proteins,
have similar mechanisms of actions but different structures. By binding to the ligand or
receptor that is expressed on the cell surface, both monoclonal antibodies and fusion proteins
inhibit the binding between the ligand and its specific receptor, block the target signaling
pathway and prevent downstream effects, such as activation of inflammatory cascade.

Rather than binding to only one target as mono-specifics do, bi-specific antibodies
simultaneously bind to two targets. By doing so, bi-specific antibodies can modulate two
signaling pathways, bring two types of cells into close proximity and/or target the bi-specifics
to specific cells.
