GLOSSARY OF TECHNICAL TERMS

area under the concentration-time curve from the first
time point measured (0) to the last time point measured
(t)

the branch of immunology that studies the misdirected
immune response that occurs when the immune system
goes awry and attacks the body itself. Autoimmunity is
present
in everyone and is usually
harmless. However, autoimmunity can cause a broad
range of human illnesses, known collectively as
autoimmune diseases

to some extent

a type of white blood cell that differs from other types of
lymphocytes by expressing B cell
receptors on its
surface, and responsible for producing antibodies

the absence of a significant difference in the rate and
extent to which the active ingredient or active molecular
portion in pharmaceutical equivalents or pharmaceutical
alternatives becomes available at the site of drug action
when administered

the
drugs having the equivalent bioavailability,
equivalent rates and extents of absorption of parent drugs
or active metabolites from a dosage form into the
systemic circulation.

i.e.

the time in which a drug and its target associate and
dissociate

biological drugs which are designed to have the same
amino acid sequence and the equivalent (but not identical
or clinical better) active properties as compared to, and
which are not necessarily clinically interchangeable with,
reference originator drugs that have already received
marketing approvals, not to be confused with such other
terms as “biobetters” (which are clinically better than
reference originator drugs), “biogenerics” (which are
clinically interchangeable with reference originator
drugs) or “follow-on biologics” (which may or may not
include biosimilars) even though these terms are used
interchangeably under certain regulatory regimes and in
certain contexts
