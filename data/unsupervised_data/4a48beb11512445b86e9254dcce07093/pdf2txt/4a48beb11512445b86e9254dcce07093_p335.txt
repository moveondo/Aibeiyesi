series D preferred shares, which was recognized as a gain to the Company. Such gain was
partially offset by an upward adjustment on the fair value of series D preferred shares resulted
from a share premium contributed by the issuance of series E preferred shares, which
represents the excess of the issue price for series E preferred shares over the fair value for
series D preferred shares at the issue date of Series E preferred shares. However, such excess
of issue price was relatively limited and, as a result, such upward adjustment in the fair value
of series D preferred shares was less than the downward adjustment resulting from their
lowered liquidation preference, leading to a decrease in the fair value of series D preferred
shares and a gain on fair value change in respect of our other financial liabilities.
