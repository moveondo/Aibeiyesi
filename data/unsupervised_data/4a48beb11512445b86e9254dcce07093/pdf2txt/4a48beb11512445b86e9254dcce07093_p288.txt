IBI-318

IBI-318 is a bi-specific antibody incorporating sintilimab anti-PD-1-binding backbone
that we are developing in collaboration with Eli Lilly for the treatment of cancers. It
simultaneously binds to both PD-1 and an undisclosed target.

IBI-319

IBI-319 is a bi-specific antibody incorporating sintilimab anti-PD-1-binding backbone
that we are developing in collaboration with Eli Lilly for the treatment of cancers. It
simultaneously binds to both PD-1 and an undisclosed target.

IBI-323

IBI-323 is an anti-LAG-3/PD-L1 bi-specific antibody that we are developing for the
treatment of cancers. IBI-323 simultaneously inhibits LAG-3 binding to MHC Class II and
PD-L1 binding to PD-1. IBI-323 also has the potential to further enhance the specific killing
activity of T cells by tethering LAG-3 positive T cells with PD-L1 positive tumor cells. Our
pre-clinical data show that IBI-323’s in vitro efficacy and in vivo efficacy are both better than
a combination therapy of an anti-LAG-3 mono-specific antibody and an anti-PD-L1 mono-
specific antibody.

The table below sets forth a comparison of our PD-L1 drug candidates and their
competitors drug candidates in China which are approved or in Phase 3 or more advanced
clinical trial stage:
