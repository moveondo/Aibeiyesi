The manufacturing
process primarily
includes building
expression system and
cell bank, filling, cell
culture and purification

The manufacturing
system for monoclonal
antibodies is more
mature as compared to
that for bi-specific
antibodies

The manufacturing
system for bi-specific
antibodies is still
developing. There are
over 60 new platforms
which are exploring
new manufacturing
pathways of
bi-specific. Compared
with monoclonal
antibodies,
manufacturing for
bi-specific needs more
modification in either
expression system or
antibodies. Currently,
there are only two
commercial products of
bi-specific antibodies,
namely Removab and
Blincyto, and thus,
there is no common
industry practice of
commercial
manufacturing.
Exploration of
commercial
manufacturing mainly
focuses on chemical
conjugation, quadroma
technology and gene
engineering

Monoclonal antibodies are one of the largest segments of the overall biologics market,
comprising 43.2% of the total biologics market by sales revenue in 2017, according to the Frost
& Sullivan Report. The breakdown of the global biologics market in terms of sales revenue by
category in 2017 is illustrated in the diagram below.
