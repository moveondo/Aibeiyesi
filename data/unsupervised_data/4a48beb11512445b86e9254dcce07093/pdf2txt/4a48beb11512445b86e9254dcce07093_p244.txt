the various PD-1 antibodies,

Improved biochemical properties, more robust receptor occupancy, and longer blockade
of PD-1 on lymphocytes, not only lead to more robust pre-clinical tumor efficacy of sintilimab,
but could also lead to more robust clinical benefit for patients. While there is no head-to-head
clinical
sintilimab, nivolumab and
pembrolizumab have all completed Phase 2 trials in relapsed/refractory classical Hodgkin’s
lymphoma. Sintilimab has demonstrated robust clinical efficacy in this patient population. As
judged by an independent radiological review committee, 79.2% of the 96 patients treated with
sintilimab in our registration trial achieved a best overall objective response (week 24 data),
17.7% of the patients achieved a best complete response (week 15 data), and the disease control
rate is 97.9% (week 24 data). The efficacy results from our registration trial for sintilimab are
summarized in the following table.

Abbreviations: N = sample size (96 patients); IRRC = independent radiological review committee; IWG 2007
= International Working Group 2007; CR = complete response rate; PR = partial response rate; SD = stable
disease; PD = progressive disease; ORR = objective response rate; DCR = disease control rate; CI = confidence
interval.

Note: The 24-week response measurement does not include PET scans. Hence, IWG complete response cannot
be assessed at this time point and the complete response rate (CR) in the table is week 15 data. Partial
responses increased at 24 weeks due to four patients with stable disease achieving partial response. The
objective response rate therefore increased to 79.2%.

These important clinical parameters achieved from treatment with sintilimab are
numerically similar to the results achieved from treatment with nivolumab or pembrolizumab,
as shown in the table below. Although the patient populations are all relapsed/refractory
classical Hodgkin’s lymphoma,
identical.
Brentuximab vedotin is not available in China and autologous stem cell transplantation is less
common in China than in the United States and the European Union. In addition, the timing of
response measurements is different across studies.
