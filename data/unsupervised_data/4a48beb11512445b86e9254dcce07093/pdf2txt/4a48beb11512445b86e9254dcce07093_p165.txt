Overview of China’s PD-1 and PD-L1 Antibody Market

The first few marketed drugs in a class tend to have a better performance and a larger
market share because physicians will have more experience in the usage of these drugs and may
be more likely to prescribe them. The longer the lead time before the entry of rivals, the higher
the likelihood of achieving the first-mover advantages. In China, there are only two approved
PD-1 antibodies, Bristol-Myers Squibb’s Opdivo (nivolumab) and Merck’s Keytruda
(pembrolizumab), and there are no approved PD-L1 antibodies yet. On June 15, 2018, the
NMPA approved Bristol-Myers Squibb’s Opdivo (nivolumab) for the treatment of locally
advanced or metastatic NSCLC after prior platinum-based chemotherapy in adult patients
without EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberration. On July 26, 2018, the NMPA approved
Merck’s Keytruda (pembrolizumab) for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or
metastatic melanoma following failure of one prior line of therapy. Early entrants will be able
to understand which physicians may potentially become the best advocates of the newly
developed PD-1 or PD-L1 antibody products and eventually improve awareness of brands and
convince patients and other physicians of the efficacy of the PD-1 or PD-L1 antibody products.

As of the date of this prospectus, the retail prices of Opdivo is RMB9,260/100 mg and
RMB4,591/40 mg, which are approximately 52.9% of its retail prices in the U.S., and the retail
price of Keytruda is RMB17,918/100 mg in China, which is approximately 54.0% of its retail
price in the U.S.
