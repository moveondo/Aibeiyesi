an abnormal mass of tissue that usually does not contain
cysts or liquid areas. Solid tumors may be benign (not
cancer), or malignant (cancer). Different types of solid
tumors are named for the type of cells that form them.
Examples of solid tumors are sarcomas, carcinomas, and
lymphomas

spongioblasts, embryonic epithelial cells that develop
around the neural tube and transform into cells of the
supporting connective tissue of nerve cells or cells of
