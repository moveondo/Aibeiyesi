As illustrated by the following graph, VEGF-A can bind with VEGFR-2 and activate the
downstream pathway to angiogenesis. Anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody such as bevacizumab
can bind with VEGF, including VEGF-A, and thus block the angiogenesis pathway and depress
the growth of solid tumors.

Market Opportunity and Competition

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a subset of lung cancer. According to the Frost
& Sullivan Report, in China, NSCLC patients increased from 0.6 million in 2013 to 0.7 million
in 2017, representing a CAGR of 3.5%, and are expected to reach 0.8 million in 2022 at a
CAGR of 2.7% from 2017 to 2022 and reach 1.1 million in 2030 with a CAGR of 3.1% from
2023 to 2030.

Avastin is the best-selling drug among all anti-VEGF monoclonal antibodies. According
to the Frost & Sullivan Report, worldwide sales of Avastin were US$6.8 billion in 2017 and
are estimated to remain near US$7 billion in 2018.

Bevacizumab has been approved for advanced relapsed/refractory NSCLC and metastatic
CRC in China and has been included in the National Reimbursement Drug List. According to
the Frost & Sullivan Report, the China sales of bevacizumab were RMB1.7 billion in 2017 and
are expected to reach RMB8.8 billion in 2022 and RMB16.6 billion in 2030. There is one other
bevacizumab biosimilar drug candidate for which NDA has been submitted to NMPA. Besides
our IBI-305, there are seven other bevacizumab biosimilar drug candidates in Phase 3 clinical
trials in China.
