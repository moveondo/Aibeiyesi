UNDERWRITING

whether any such transaction described in (a), (b) or (c) above is to be settled by delivery
of such Shares or other securities of the Company, in cash or otherwise (whether or not
the settlement or delivery of such Shares or other securities will be completed within the
Lock-up Period), provided that the above restrictions do not apply to Shares acquired by
him/her/it subsequent to the completion of the Global Offering and will not prevent
him/her/it from using the Shares beneficially owned by him/her/it as security (including
a charge or a pledge) in favor of an authorized institution (as defined in the Banking
Ordinance (Chapter 155 of the Laws of Hong Kong)) for a bona fide commercial loan
provided that (i) he/she/it
immediately informs the Company and the Joint Global
Coordinators of such pledge or charge together with the number of Shares so pledged or
charged, and (ii) the person making such loan undertakes to be bound by the restrictions
on disposal herein during the Lock-up Period and which restrictions shall apply to any
disposal of the Investor Shares on exercise of any enforcement action or foreclosure
following a default under such loan.

Commissions and Expenses

The Underwriters will receive an underwriting commission of 3% of the aggregate Offer
Price of all the Offer Shares (including any Offer Shares to be issued pursuant to the exercise
of the Over-allotment Option), out of which they will pay any sub-underwriting commissions
and other fees.

The Underwriters may receive a discretionary incentive fee of up to 1% of the aggregate
Offer Price of all the Offer Shares (including any Offer Shares to be issued pursuant to the
exercise of the Over-allotment Option).

For any unsubscribed Hong Kong Offer Shares reallocated to the International Offering,
the underwriting commission will not be paid to the Hong Kong Underwriters but will instead
be paid, at the rate applicable to the International Offering, to the relevant International
Underwriters.

The aggregate underwriting commissions payable to the Underwriters in relation to the
Global Offering (assuming an Offer Price of HK$13.25 per Offer Share (which is the mid-point
of the Offer Price range), the full payment of the discretionary incentive fee and the exercise
of the Over-allotment Option in full) will be approximately HK$125.3 million.

The aggregate underwriting commissions and fees together with the Stock Exchange
listing fees, the SFC transaction levy and the Stock Exchange trading fee, legal and other
professional fees and printing and all other expenses relating to the Global Offering are
estimated to be approximately HK$179.3 million (assuming an Offer Price of HK$13.25 per
Offer Share (which is the mid-point of the Offer Price range),
the full payment of the
discretionary incentive fee and the exercise of the Over-allotment Option in full) and will be
paid by our Company.
