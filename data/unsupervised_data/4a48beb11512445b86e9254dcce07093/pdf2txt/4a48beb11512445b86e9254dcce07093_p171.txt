INDUSTRY OVERVIEW

High revenue growth rate in the first quarter of 2018

Since the expansion of China’s national reimbursement drug list, rituximab, bevacizumab
and trastuzumab have become reimbursable drugs in China. Given the affordable annual
treatment cost and the high patient
the sales revenue of these three
originator drugs grew significantly from the fourth quarter of 2017 to the first quarter of 2018,
with a growth rate of 22.0%, 32.0% and 24.2% respectively for rituximab, bevacizumab and
trastuzumab. With biosimilars’ acceptable biosimilarity and interchangeability with their
reference products, cheaper prices, and huge treatment demand amongst China’s cancer and
autoimmune disease patients, sales revenue of biosimilars is expected to ramp up fast as well.

Market Drivers of China’s Biosimilar Market

For 2017, the biosimilar market in China was RMB1.2 billion in China, but it is expected
to reach RMB16.9 billion in 2022 and further grow to RMB58.6 billion in 2030 given (i) the
low penetration of biosimilars in China as demonstrated by global comparison, (ii) favorable
government policies, (iii) barriers to acceptance of biosimilars that can be overcome, and (iv)
the calculation of market size based on a bottom-up methodology. Each of these factors is
further discussed below.

Global comparison

Biosimilar is a fast-growing segment in global biologics market by revenue. In 2017,
global biosimilar market reached US$5.6 billion and accounted for 2.3% of the global biologics
market. The global biosimilar market is expected to continue to grow to US$43.3 billion in
2022 and account for 10.7% of the global biologics market.

Although we expect China’s biosimilar market to have a high growth rate of 70.9% from
2017 through 2022, both the absolute size of China’s biosimilar market and its market share
of China’s biologics market are very small. In 2022, China’s biosimilar market is expected to
grow to RMB16.9 billion, accounting for only 3.5% of the China’s biologics market. In
addition, China’s biosimilar market
is expected to only account for 6.1% of the global
biosimilar market.

In sum, China’s biosimilar market is, and will in the short term remain, a small component
of the global biosimilar market and China’s biologics market, even with a reasonably high
growth rate.
