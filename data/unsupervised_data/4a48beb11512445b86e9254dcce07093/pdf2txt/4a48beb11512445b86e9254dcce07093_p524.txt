APPENDIX III

SUMMARY OF THE CONSTITUTION OF THE
COMPANY AND CAYMAN COMPANIES LAW

Any dividend, interest or other sum payable in cash to a holder of shares may be paid by
cheque or warrant sent through the post addressed to the registered address of the member of
the Company entitled, or in the case of joint holders, to the registered address of the person
whose name stands first in the register of members of the Company in respect of the joint
holding or to such person and to such address as the holder or joint holders may in writing
direct. Every cheque or warrant so sent shall be made payable to the order of the holder or, in
the case of joint holders, to the order of the holder whose name stands first on the register of
members of the Company in respect of such shares, and shall be sent at his or their risk and
the payment of any such cheque or warrant by the bank on which it is drawn shall operate as
a good discharge to the Company in respect of the dividend and/or bonus represented thereby,
notwithstanding that it may subsequently appear that the same has been stolen or that any
endorsement thereon has been forged. The Company may cease sending such cheques for
dividend entitlements or dividend warrants by post if such cheques or warrants have been left
uncashed on two consecutive occasions. However, the Company may exercise its power to
cease sending cheques for dividend entitlements or dividend warrants after the first occasion
on which such a cheque or warrant is returned undelivered. Any one of two or more joint
holders may give effectual receipts for any dividends or other monies payable or property
distributable in respect of the shares held by such joint holders.

Any dividend unclaimed for six years from the date of declaration of such dividend may

be forfeited by the Directors and shall revert to the Company.

The Directors may, with the sanction of the members of the Company in general meeting,
direct that any dividend be satisfied wholly or in part by the distribution of specific assets of
any kind, and in particular of paid up shares, debentures or warrants to subscribe securities of
any other company, and where any difficulty arises in regard to such distribution the Directors
may settle it as they think expedient, and in particular may disregard fractional entitlements,
round the same up or down or provide that the same shall accrue to the benefit of the Company,
and may fix the value for distribution of such specific assets and may determine that cash
payments shall be made to any members of the Company upon the footing of the value so fixed
in order to adjust the rights of all parties, and may vest any such specific assets in trustees as
may seem expedient to the Directors.
