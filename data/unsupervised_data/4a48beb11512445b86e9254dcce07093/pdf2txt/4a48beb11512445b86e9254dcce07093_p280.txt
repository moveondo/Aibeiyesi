approximately two years after diagnosis of the disease. According to a study published in 2004
in the journal Ophthalmology, approximately 1.2 million people in the United States suffer
from wet AMD. Based on estimates from AMD Alliance International, a non-profit
organization focused on AMD awareness, and census growth data, we estimate there are
approximately 293,000 new cases of wet AMD each year in the United States. Because the risk
of developing wet AMD increases with age, we expect that the overall aging of the population
will result in a significant increase in the number of wet AMD cases, both in the United States
and worldwide. According to the Frost & Sullivan Report, the prevalence of wet AMD in China
was 3.4 million in 2017 and is expected to reach 4.0 million in 2022 and 4.8 million in 2030.
We believe that there is a significant commercial demand for the treatment of wet AMD.

Ranibizumab (sold under the trade name of Lucentis by Norvartis), conbercept (sold
under the trade name of Langmu by Chengdu Kanghong) and aflibercept (sold under the trade
name of Eylea by Bayer) have been approved in China for the treatment of wet AMD, and
ranibizumab and conbercept have been included in the National Reimbursement Drug List.

The current biological treatment for wet AMD include ranibizumab, aflibercept and
conbercept. According to the Frost & Sullivan Report, conbercept achieved sales of RMB617
million in China in 2017. Besides us, there are four other biologic candidates treating wet AMD
in clinical development in China. The table below sets forth the information of the foregoing
biologic candidates treating wet AMD in clinical development in China:
