For the purpose of impairment assessment for subscription receivables for restricted shares, receivables due
from share options holders, subscription receivables for Preferred Shares and other loans, the loss allowance is
measured at an amount equal to 12m ECL. In determining the ECL for these financial assets, the directors of the
Company have taken into account the financial positions of the counterparties in estimating the probability of default
of each of the other receivables and other current assets occurring within their respective loss assessment time
horizon, as well as the loss upon default in each case. The directors of the Company considered that the lifetime ECL
allowance is insignificant.
