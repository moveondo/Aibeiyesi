APPENDIX I

Interest rate risk

ACCOUNTANTS’ REPORT

The Group is exposed to fair value interest rate risk in relation to other loans (note 19) and other
financial liabilities (note 28) and cash flow interest rate risk in relation to variable-rate bank borrowings (note
26) and bank balances (note 22). The Company currently does not enter into any hedging instrument for both
of the fair value interest rate risk and cash flow interest rate risk.

Sensitivity analysis

The sensitivity analyses below have been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for bank
borrowings at the end of the reporting period. The analysis is prepared assuming the amounts of these financial
instruments outstanding at the end of the relevant periods were outstanding for the whole year. A 50 basis point
increase or decrease in the prevailing rates of relevant banks is used when reporting interest rate risk internally
to key management personnel and represents management’s assessment of the reasonably possible change in
interest rates.

If interest rates had been 50 basis points higher/lower for variables rate bank borrowings, with all other
variables held constant, the Group’s post-tax loss for the years ended 31 December 2016 and 2017 and six
months ended 30 June 2017 and 2018 would increase/decrease by RMB2,500,000, RMB2,550,000,
RMB1,250,000 (unaudited) and RMB1,742,500, respectively.

Bank balances are excluded from sensitivity analysis as the directors of the Company consider that the
exposure of cash flow interest rate risk arising from variable-rate bank balances is insignificant because the
current market interest rates are relatively low and stable.

Other price risk

The Group is exposed to other price risk through Preferred Shares classified as other financial liabilities.

Sensitivity analysis

The sensitivity analyses below have been determined based on the exposure to equity price risk at end

of the reporting period for financial liabilities at FVTPL.

If the equity value of the Company had been changed based on the 5% higher/lower:

(cid:129)

the post-tax loss of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2016 would increase by
RMB139,018,000 and decrease by RMB133,511,000, as a result of the changes in fair value of
the Company’s equity value;

the post-tax loss of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2017 would increase by
RMB142,031,000 and decrease by RMB136,585,000, as a result of the changes in fair value of
the Company’s equity value;

the post-tax loss of the Group for the six months ended 30 June 2018 would increase by
RMB166,724,000 and decrease by RMB161,921,000, as a result of the changes in fair value of
the Company’s equity value.
