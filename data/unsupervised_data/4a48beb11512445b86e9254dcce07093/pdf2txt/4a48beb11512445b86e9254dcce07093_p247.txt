The preliminary results from this study were published on the official website of the
American Society of Clinical Oncology, or ASCO, on May 16, 2018. The updated and final
results from this study were presented at the 2018 ASCO Annual Meeting in Chicago in a
poster session on June 4, 2018 (Abstract No. 7536).

We submitted our original NDA for sintilimab for the treatment of relapsed/refractory
classical Hodgkin’s lymphoma on December 1, 2017, which was accepted by the NMPA on
December 7, 2017. In light of the new guidance released in February 2018 by the Center for
Drug Evaluation, or CDE, under the NMPA, we resubmitted our NDA for sintilimab for the
treatment of relapsed/refractory classical Hodgkin’s lymphoma on April 3, 2018, which was
accepted by the NMPA on April 16, 2018. We became one of the first companies to have an
NDA for a PD-1/PD-L1 product accepted by the NMPA and we were granted priority review
status on April 23, 2018. We have not had material communications with the NMPA since our
submission of the NDA and we are not aware of any material concern that has resulted from
the NMPA’s review of the NDA for sintilimab. As such, relapsed/refractory classical Hodgkin’s
lymphoma is expected to be the first cancer indication for which sintilimab will be approved
for marketing.

Clinical Development Plan

Since beginning clinical trials in October 2016 to the Latest Practicable Date, we have
treated 567 patients with sintilimab. Based on these trials, we believe that sintilimab
demonstrates anti-tumor activity across multiple tumor types and has an acceptable safety
profile. In addition to our completed registration trial in China to evaluate sintilimab in patients
with relapsed/refractory classical Hodgkin’s lymphoma, we are executing a broad development
program targeting an array of cancer indications including several registration trials for
sintilimab, both as a monotherapy and as part of a combination therapy, and both in China and
in the U.S., which is intended to support our regulatory submissions for multiple indications
both in China and globally.
