Melanoma is mainly caused by intense ultraviolet light exposure. It is less prevalent in
China than in the North America or Europe. Also according to the Frost & Sullivan Report,
from 2013 to 2017, the number of melanoma patients in China increased from 7,500 to 8,500
in China, and is expected to increase to 9,600 in 2022 and 12,100 in 2030. Besides us, there
