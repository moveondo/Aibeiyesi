“PD-L2”

GLOSSARY OF TECHNICAL TERMS

programmed cell death protein 1, an immune checkpoint
receptor expressed on T cells, B cells and macrophages.
The normal function of PD-1 is to turn off the T cell
mediated immune response as part of the process that
stops a healthy immune system from attacking other
pathogenic cells in the body. When PD-1 on the surface
of a T cell attaches to certain proteins on the surface of a
normal cell or a cancer cell, the T cell turns off its ability
to kill the cell

PD-1 ligand 1, which is a protein on the surface of a
normal cell or a cancer cell
that attaches to certain
proteins on the surface of the T cell that causes the T cell
to turn off its ability to kill the cancer cell

PD-1 ligand 2, which is a protein on the surface of a
normal cell or a cancer cell
that attaches to certain
proteins on the surface of the T cell that causes the T cell
to turn off its ability to kill the cancer cell
