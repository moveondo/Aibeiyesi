RISK FACTORS

As a result, we may not be able to realize the benefit of current or future collaborations,
strategic partnerships or the license of our third-party drugs if we are unable to successfully
integrate such products with our existing operations and company culture, which could delay
our timelines or otherwise adversely affect our business. We also cannot be certain that,
following a strategic transaction or license, we will achieve the revenue or specific net income
that justifies such transaction. If we are unable to reach agreements with suitable collaborators
on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all, we may have to curtail the development of a
drug candidate, reduce or delay its development program or one or more of our other
development programs, delay its potential commercialization or reduce the scope of any sales
or marketing activities, or
increase our expenditures and undertake development or
commercialization activities at our own expense.
to fund and undertake
development or commercialization activities on our own, we may need to obtain additional
expertise and additional capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all.
If we fail to enter into collaborations and do not have sufficient funds or expertise to undertake
the necessary development and commercialization activities, we may not be able to further
develop our drug candidates or bring them to market and generate product sales revenue, which
would harm our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations.

If we elect

We may rely on third parties to manufacture a portion of our clinical and commercial drug
supplies. Our business could be harmed if those third parties fail to provide us with sufficient
quantities of product or fail to do so at acceptable quality levels or prices.

Although we intend to further develop and rely on our own manufacturing facilities, we
may use third parties as part of our manufacturing process and for the clinical and commercial
supply of our drug candidates, which is not expected to be a major undertaking in addition to
owning and operating our
in-house manufacturing facilities. Reliance on third-party
manufacturers would expose us to the following risks:

we may be unable to identify manufacturers on acceptable terms or at all because the
number of potential manufacturers is limited and the NMPA, FDA, EMA or other
comparable regulatory authorities must evaluate and/or approve any manufacturers
as part of their regulatory oversight of our drug candidates. This evaluation would
require new testing and cGMP-compliance inspections by NMPA, FDA, EMA or
other comparable regulatory authorities;

our third-party manufacturers might be unable to timely manufacture our drug
candidates or produce the quantity and quality required to meet our clinical and
commercial needs, if any;

manufacturers are subject to ongoing periodic unannounced inspection by the FDA
and corresponding state agencies in the United States to ensure strict compliance
with cGMP and other government regulations and by other comparable regulatory
authorities for corresponding non-U.S. requirements. We do not have control over
third-party manufacturers’ compliance with these regulations and requirements;

we may not own, or may have to share, the intellectual property rights to any
improvements made by our third-party manufacturers in the manufacturing process
for our drug candidates;
