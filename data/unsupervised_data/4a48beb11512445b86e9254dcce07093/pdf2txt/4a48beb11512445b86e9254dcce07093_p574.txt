APPENDIX IV

STATUTORY AND GENERAL INFORMATION

Notwithstanding any provisions to the contrary in the Post-IPO ESOP, if on the relevant
date of exercise there are restrictions or conditions imposed by the relevant
laws and
regulations to which the grantee is subject and the grantee has not obtained approval,
exemption or waiver from the relevant regulatory authorities for the subscription of and dealing
in the Shares, the grantee may sell the options to such transferee, subject to the approval by
the Board, which shall not unreasonably withhold or delay such approval. In the event that the
options are transferred to a connected person of our Company, no Shares shall be allotted and
issued upon the exercise of the options by a connected person of our Company unless the Board
is satisfied that the allotment and issue of Shares will not trigger any breach of the Listing
Rules, the Articles of Association, the Companies Law or the Takeovers Code.

(v) Termination

The Shareholders by ordinary resolution in general meeting or the Board may at any time
resolve to terminate the operation of the Post-IPO ESOP prior to the expiry of the Post-IPO
ESOP and in such event no further options will be offered or granted but the provisions of the
Post-IPO ESOP shall remain in full force to the extent necessary to give effect to the exercise
of any options granted prior thereto or otherwise as may be required in accordance with the
provisions of the Post-IPO ESOP. Options complying with the provisions of Chapter 17 of the
Listing Rules which are granted during the life of the Post-IPO ESOP and remain unexercised
and unexpired immediately prior to the termination of the operation of the Post-IPO ESOP shall
continue to be valid and exercisable in accordance with their terms of issue after the
termination of the Post-IPO ESOP.

Details of the options granted, including options exercised or outstanding, under the
Post-IPO ESOP shall be disclosed in the circular to the Shareholders seeking approval of the
new scheme established after the termination of the Post-IPO ESOP.

(w) Value of options

Our Directors consider it inappropriate to disclose the value of options which may be
granted under the Post-IPO Share Option Scheme as if they had been granted as of the Latest
Practicable Date. Any such valuation will have to be made on the basis of a certain option
pricing model or other method that depends on various assumptions including the exercise
price, the exercise period, interest rate, expected volatility and other variables. As no options
have been granted, certain variables are not available for calculating the value of options. Our
Directors believe that any calculation of the value of options granted as of the Latest
Practicable Date would be based on a number of speculative assumptions that are not
meaningful and would be misleading to investors.
