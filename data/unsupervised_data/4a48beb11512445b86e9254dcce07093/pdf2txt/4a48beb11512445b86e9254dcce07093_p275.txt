Higher affinity for human PCSK9

and

binding

We conducted in vitro studies to compare the equilibrium binding affinity of IBI-306 for
human PCSK9 with that of alirocumab and evolocumab and the results showed that of IBI-306
is higher than alirocumab and evolocumab. The table below shows equilibrium binding affinity
of PCSK9 antibody fragments. The binding affinity of the Fab fragments of 3 PCSK9
antibodies for human PCSK9 is shown. Human PCSK9 is fixed to a Meso Scale Discovery
plate
by
electrochemiluminescence. The dissociation constant, Kd, is a ratio of unbound to bound
antibody: PCSK9 complexes measured in molar (M) units. The smaller the number, the tighter
the antibody binding affinity. In this study IBI-306 binds to PCSK9 approximately 4 times
more tightly than evolocumab and 17 times tighter than alirocumab. We believe that IBI-306’s
higher binding affinity for its target will lead to more clinical benefit at a lower dosage level
and a more convenient dosing schedule for the treatment of hyperlipidemia.

Longer duration of LDL-C reduction

The results from a monkey study indicate that IBI-306 reduced LDL-C reduction level
and has a longer duration of serum LDL-C reduction (from 24 hours through up to 504 hours
after administration)
than evolocumab (from 24 hours through up to 336 hours after
administration) at the same dose level. The chart below shows LDL-C reduction of IBI-306
compared to evolocumab. Normal monkeys were given a single 10 mg/kg dose of IBI-306 or
evolocumab. IBI-306 has a long duration of LDL-C reduction most evident from the 500 hour
timepoint. We believe that the longer duration will allow us to achieve a more convenient (less
frequent) dosing schedule (longer than 6-week dosing) for the treatment of hyperlipidemia.
