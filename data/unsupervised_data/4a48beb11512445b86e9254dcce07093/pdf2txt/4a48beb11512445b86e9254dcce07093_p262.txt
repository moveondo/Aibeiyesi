patients currently have only limited treatment options. MabThera was approved for treatment
of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma in China and has been listed in National Reimbursement Drug
List 2017. Besides our IBI-301, there are one other rituximab biosimilar drug candidate with
an NDA under review by the NMPA and two other rituximab biosimilar drug candidates in
Phase 3 clinical trials in China.

Competition in the oncology therapeutic area to which IBI-301 belongs is extremely
fierce given the abundance of existing competing drugs and drug candidates that continue to
increase competition in the market. The following table sets forth comparisons between
IBI-301 and its competitive drug candidates in China which are approved to market or in late
stage clinical trials:

Rituximab are included in the NRDL List B Catalogue. As Rituximab entered into the NRDL List B Catalogue
via price negotiation, it will automatically be added into the PRDLs when each provinces and municipalities
updates its PRDL according to Notice on Inclusion of 36 Drugs in NRDL List B Catalogue for National Basic
Medical Insurance, Work Injury Insurance and Maternity Insurance (《關於將36種藥品納入國家基本醫療保
險、工傷保險和生育保險藥品目錄乙類範圍的通知》). As of August 9, 2018,
and
municipalities, including Heilongjiang, Shanghai, Henan, Jilin, Jiangxi, Shandong, Jiangsu and Liaoning, have
recently updated their PRDLs to include rituximab as a List B drug.
