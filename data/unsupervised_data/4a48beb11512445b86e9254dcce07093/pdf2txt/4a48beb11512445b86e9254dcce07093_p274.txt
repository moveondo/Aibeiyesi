Currently Repatha (evolocumab) is the only one marketed PCSK inhibitor in China,
which received the approval by the NMPA for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia in August
2018. Besides us, there are three other anti-PCSK9 drug candidates in clinical development in
China,
including Junshi’s JS002, Amgen’s Repatha (evolocumab) and Sanofi’s Praluent
(alirocumab). The table below sets forth the information of the foregoing anti-PCSK9 drug
candidates in clinical development in China:

Current Treatments and Limitations

The approved anti-PCSK9 drugs, alirocumab (sold under the trade name Praluent by
Sanofi) and evolocumab (sold under the trade name Repatha by Amgen), have limitations in
terms of their binding affinity for PCSK9. The ability of an antibody to produce a beneficial
effect in a patient depends on its ability to block the target protein. Blocking the target protein
depends on several factors including the binding affinity of the antibody for the target, the
distribution of the antibody in the body and the duration that the antibody binds the target. We
believe that higher binding affinity of IBI-306 for PCSK9 compared with the binding affinity
of evolocumab and alirocumab could provide more durable responses in patients at a lower
dose strength, which could allow IBI-306 to provide more clinical benefits at lower dosage
levels and also at the same dose level achieve both a convenient (shorter and less frequent)
dosing schedule and a lower dosage level for patients. In comparison, alirocumab and
evolocumab require monthly injections with 2-3 separate injections each dose and the injecting
time varies from 40 seconds to 9 minutes depending on the product.

Potential Advantages

Based on initial pre-clinical data, we believe that IBI-306 has the following potential
competitive advantages as compared to approved anti-PCSK9 drugs alirocumab and
evolocumab:
