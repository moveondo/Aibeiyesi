Adjusted to reflect subsequent share splits and other capital reorganizations, as applicable. Cost per
share paid is not applicable to the pre-IPO investments in Innovent Suzhou, which is a PRC limited
liability company that does not have a share capital.

The discount to the Offer Price is calculated based on the assumption that the Offer Price is HK$13.25
per Share, being the mid-point of the indicative Offer Price range of HK$12.50 to HK$14.00, on the
basis that 1,118,150,710 Shares are expected to be in issue immediately upon completion of the Global
Offering (including completion of the conversion of the Preferred Shares into ordinary shares to be
effected prior to Listing), and assuming the Over-allotment Option is not exercised and no shares are
issued pursuant to the Equity Plans. Discount to the offer price is not applicable to the pre-IPO
investment in Innovent Suzhou.
