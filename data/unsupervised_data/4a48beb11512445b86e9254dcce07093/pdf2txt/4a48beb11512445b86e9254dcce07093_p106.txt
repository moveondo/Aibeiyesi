RISK FACTORS

We have significantly increased the size and capabilities of our organization, and we may
experience difficulties in managing our growth.

We had 777 employees as of the Latest Practicable Date. Most of our employees are
full-time. As our development and commercialization plans and strategies evolve, we must add
a significant number of additional managerial, operational, manufacturing, sales, marketing,
financial and other personnel. Our recent growth and any future growth will impose significant
added responsibilities on members of management, including:

identifying,
employees;

recruiting,

integrating, maintaining,

and motivating additional

managing our internal development efforts effectively, including the clinical and
regulatory authority review process for our drug candidates, while complying with
our contractual obligations to contractors and other third parties; and

improving our operational, financial and management controls, reporting systems
and procedures.

Our future financial performance and our ability to commercialize our drug candidates
will depend, in part, on our ability to effectively manage our recent growth and any future
growth, and our management may also have to divert a disproportionate amount of its attention
away from day-to-day activities in order to devote a substantial amount of time to managing
these growth activities.

If we are not able to effectively manage our growth and further expand our organization
by hiring new employees and expanding our groups of consultants and contractors as needed,
we may not be able to successfully implement the tasks necessary to further develop and
commercialize our drug candidates and, accordingly, may not achieve our
research,
development and commercialization goals.

If we engage in acquisitions or strategic partnerships,
this may increase our capital
requirements, dilute our shareholders, cause us to incur debt or assume contingent
liabilities, and subject us to other risks.

From time to time, we may evaluate various acquisitions and strategic partnerships,
including licensing or acquiring complementary products,
intellectual property rights,
technologies or businesses. Any completed, in-process or potential acquisition or strategic
partnership may entail numerous risks, including:
