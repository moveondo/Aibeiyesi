NSCLC

We are conducting a multi-center Phase 3 clinical trial in China of sintilimab as a
second-line monotherapy in patients with advanced or metastatic squamous NSCLC. This trial
is designed as a superiority trial comparing sintilimab with standard of care chemotherapy
using docetaxel. We have enrolled 119 patients in 34 trial sites as of June 7, 2018 and plan to
enroll a total of 266 patients in this trial. The primary endpoint of this trial is overall survival.

We are conducting a multi-center Phase 1b (dose expansion) study in China to evaluate
in combination with
the safety and efficacy of sintilimab at 200 mg Q3W dose level
pemetrexed and platinum in patients with first-line non-squamous NSCLC. As of June 28,
2018, we recruited 21 patients, exceeding our planned sample size of 20 patients at 4 trial sites.
As of the same date, the combination demonstrated an ORR of 68.4%, based on data from 19
patients with at least one radiological assessment among the 21 patients. The study also
demonstrated a safety profile for sintilimab that is consistent with the expected safety profile
of a PD-1-specific antibody. Based on the results of this Phase 1b study, we have initiated a
randomized, double-blinded, multi-center Phase 3 study in China to evaluate the safety and
efficacy of sintilimab in combination with pemetrexed and platinum-based chemotherapy in
patients with first-line non-squamous NSCLC. The primary endpoint of this Phase 3 study is
progression free survival. We plan to enroll a total of 378 patients in this Phase 3 study.

We are conducting a Phase 1b (dose expansion) study in China to evaluate the safety and
efficacy of sintilimab at 200 mg flat dose level every 3 weeks in combination with gemcitabine
and cisplatin in patients with first-line squamous NSCLC. The endpoints of this trial are
dose-limiting toxicity, tumor response, and clinical and laboratory adverse events. As of June
7, 2018, we recruited 18 out of 20 planned patients at 3 trial sites. The study demonstrated a
safety profile for sintilimab that
is consistent with the expected safety profile of a
PD-1-specific antibody. Based on the results of this study, we plan to initiate a randomized
Phase 3 clinical trial for the same combination therapy in China.

We are conducting a multi-center Phase 1b (dose expansion) study in China to evaluate
the safety and efficacy of sintilimab at 200 mg Q3W dose level as a monotherapy in patients
with second-line NSCLC. At the data cutoff of June 7, 2018, we completed patient enrollment,
recruiting 37 patients at 6 trial sites and exceeding the planned sample size of 20 patients. As
of September 1, 2018, 34 patients received at least one radiological assessment, of whom the
ORR was 17.6% and the medium average survival was 13.8 months.

We are conducting a multi-center Phase 1b (dose expansion) study in China to evaluate
the safety and efficacy of sintilimab at 200 mg Q3W dose level as a monotherapy in patients
with neuroendocrine tumors for whom the standard therapy failed. As of September 1, 2018,
we recruited 25 patients. Based on data from 22 patients who had at least one radiological
assessment, the ORR was 22.7%. Furthermore, out of the 22 patients, 19 patients were with
poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma and data from them demonstrated an ORR of
26.3%.

We plan to initiate a multi-center Phase 3 clinical trial in China to evaluate the efficacy
of sintilimab in combination with our IBI-305 on patients with NSCLC or hepatocellular
carcinoma. The relevant IND application was approved on September 18, 2018.
