WAIVERS FROM COMPLIANCE WITH THE LISTING RULES AND EXEMPTIONS FROM

THE COMPANIES (WINDING UP AND MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS) ORDINANCE

Our Company has applied to the Stock Exchange and the SFC, respectively for, (i) a
waiver from strict compliance with the disclosure requirements under Rule 17.02(1)(b) of, and
paragraph 27 of Appendix 1A to, the Listing Rules; and (ii) a certificate of exemption under
section 342A of the Companies (Winding Up and Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance
exempting the Company from strict compliance with the disclosure requirements under
paragraph 10(d) of Part I of the Third Schedule to the Companies (Winding Up and
Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance, on the ground that strict compliance with the above
requirements would be unduly burdensome for our Company for the following reasons:

(a)

(b)

(c)

(d)

(e)

given that 322 grantees are involved, strict compliance with such disclosure
requirements in setting out full details of all the grantees under the Pre-IPO Share
Incentive Plan in the prospectus would be costly and unduly burdensome for the
Company in light of a significant
increase in cost and timing for information
compilation, prospectus preparation and printing;

strict compliance with such disclosure requirements in setting out full details of all
the grantees requires the Company to seek and obtain consent from each of the 322
grantees, which would be
administratively
burdensome and costly;

significantly time

consuming,

given the nature of the business of the Company, it is extremely important for the
Company to recruit and retain talents and the success of the Company’s long-term
development plan will very much depend on the loyalty and contribution of the
grantees;

the grant and exercise in full of the share options under the Pre-IPO Share Incentive
Plan will not cause any material adverse impact in the financial position of our
Company;

non-compliance with the above disclosure requirements would not prevent
the
Company from providing its potential investors with an informed assessment of the
activities, assets, liabilities, financial position, management and prospects of the
Company; and
