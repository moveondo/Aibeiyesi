APPENDIX III

SUMMARY OF THE CONSTITUTION OF THE
COMPANY AND CAYMAN COMPANIES LAW

2.4 Variation of rights of existing shares or classes of shares

If at any time the share capital of the Company is divided into different classes of shares,
all or any of the rights attached to any class of shares for the time being issued (unless
otherwise provided for in the terms of issue of the shares of that class) may, subject to the
provisions of the Companies Law, be varied or abrogated either with the consent in writing of
the holders of not less than three-fourths in nominal value of the issued shares of that class or
with the sanction of a special resolution passed at a separate meeting of the holders of the
shares of that class. To every such separate meeting all the provisions of the Articles of
Association relating to general meetings shall mutatis mutandis apply, but so that the quorum
for the purposes of any such separate meeting and of any adjournment thereof shall be a person
or persons together holding (or representing by proxy or duly authorised representative) at the
date of the relevant meeting not less than one-third in nominal value of the issued shares of that
class.

The special rights conferred upon the holders of shares of any class shall not, unless
otherwise expressly provided in the rights attaching to or the terms of issue of such shares, be
deemed to be varied by the creation or issue of further shares ranking pari passu therewith.

2.5 Alteration of capital

The Company may, from time to time, whether or not all the shares for the time being
authorised shall have been issued and whether or not all the shares for the time being issued
shall have been fully paid up, by ordinary resolution, increase its share capital by the creation
of new shares, such new capital to be of such amount and to be divided into shares of such
respective amounts as the resolution shall prescribe.

The Company may from time to time by ordinary resolution:

(a)

consolidate and divide all or any of its share capital into shares of a larger amount
than its existing shares. On any consolidation of fully paid shares and division into
shares of larger amount, the Directors may settle any difficulty which may arise as
they think expedient and in particular (but without prejudice to the generality of the
foregoing) may as between the holders of shares to be consolidated determine which
particular shares are to be consolidated into each consolidated share, and if it shall
happen that any person shall become entitled to fractions of a consolidated share or
shares, such fractions may be sold by some person appointed by the Directors for
that purpose and the person so appointed may transfer the shares so sold to the
purchaser thereof and the validity of such transfer shall not be questioned, and so
that the net proceeds of such sale (after deduction of the expenses of such sale) may
either be distributed among the persons who would otherwise be entitled to a
fraction or fractions of a consolidated share or shares rateably in accordance with
their rights and interests or may be paid to the Company for the Company’s benefit;

(b)

cancel any shares which at the date of the passing of the resolution have not been
taken or agreed to be taken by any person, and diminish the amount of its share
capital by the amount of the shares so cancelled subject to the provisions of the
Companies Law; and
