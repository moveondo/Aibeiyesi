In vitro studies have shown that

the binding affinity of sintilimab for PD-1 is
approximately 10- and 50-fold higher compared to that of pembrolizumab and nivolumab,
respectively. This higher binding affinity allows sintilimab to bind more tightly to PD-1 on
lymphocytes and to better compete against the binding of PD-L1 and PD-L2 on tumor cells.
The following table shows the in vitro equilibrium binding characteristics of sintilimab,
pembrolizumab and nivolumab. A lower dissociation constant (Kd) indicates higher binding
affinity.

Sintilimab (IBI-308) has higher binding affinity for
human PD-1 than pembrolizumab and nivolumab

Abbreviations: M = mole (unit for amount of substance); Kd = dissociation constant; hPD-1 = human PD-1.

Prolonged binding for PD-1

The binding affinity of an antibody consists of two opposing factors: the on-rate which
is the rate at which the antibody (sintilimab) binds to the antigen (PD-1); and the off-rate which
is the rate at which the antibody releases the antigen. Pembrolizumab has a comparably fast
off-rate, and hence, after binding to PD-1 on lymphocytes, pembrolizumab can dissociate from
PD-1,
leaving the lymphocyte’s PD-1 free to bind to PD-L1 or PD-L2 on tumor cells.
Sintilimab was engineered to slow down its dissociation from PD-1 and thereby prolong the
duration of its binding to PD-1 so as to allow more robust and longer inhibition of the PD-1
signal as compared to pembrolizumab. The following graphs show the side-by-side comparison
of the binding kinetics of pembrolizumab and sintilimab.
