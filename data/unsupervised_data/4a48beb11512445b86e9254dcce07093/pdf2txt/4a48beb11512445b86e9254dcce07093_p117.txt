RISK FACTORS

we cannot provide any assurance that these PRC residents will comply with our request to
make or obtain any applicable registrations or comply with other requirements under SAFE
Circular 37 or other related rules. The failure or inability of our PRC resident shareholders to
comply with the registration procedures set forth in these regulations may subject us to fines
and legal sanctions, restrict our cross-border investment activities, and limit the ability of our
wholly foreign-owned subsidiaries in China to distribute dividends and the proceeds from any
reduction in capital, share transfer or liquidation to us, and we may also be prohibited from
injecting additional capital
into these subsidiaries. Moreover, failure to comply with the
various foreign exchange registration requirements described above could result in liability
under PRC law for circumventing applicable foreign exchange restrictions. As a result, our
business operations and our ability to distribute profits to you could be materially and
adversely affected.

Any failure to comply with PRC regulations regarding our employee equity incentive plans
or the mandatory social insurance may subject the PRC plan participants or us to fines and
other legal or administrative sanctions.

Our directors, executive officers and other employees who are PRC residents have
participated in our employee equity incentive plans. We are an overseas listed company, and
therefore, we and our directors, executive officers and other employees who are PRC citizens
or who have resided in China for a continuous period of not less than one year and who have
been granted restricted share units, restricted shares or options are subject to the Notice on
Issues Concerning the Foreign Exchange Administration for Domestic
Individuals
Participating in Share Incentive Plan of Overseas Publicly Listed Company, according to
which, employees, directors, supervisors and other management members participating in any
share incentive plan of an overseas publicly listed company who are PRC citizens or who are
non-PRC citizens residing in China for a continuous period of not less than one year, subject
to limited exceptions, are required to register with SAFE, through a domestic qualified agent,
which could be a PRC subsidiary of such overseas listed company, and complete certain other
procedures. We also face regulatory uncertainties that could restrict our ability to adopt
additional equity incentive plans for our directors and employees under PRC law.

If we or our directors, executive officers or other employees who are PRC citizens or who
have resided in China for a continuous period of not less than one year and who have been
granted equity awards fail to register the employee equity incentive plans or their exercise of
options, we and such employees may be subject to (i) legal or administrative sanctions imposed
by the SAFE or other PRC authorities, including fines; (ii) restrictions on our cross-border
investment activities; (iii) limits on the ability of our wholly owned subsidiaries in China to
distribute dividends or the proceeds from any reduction in capital, share transfer or liquidation
to us; and (iv) prohibitions on our ability to inject additional capital into these subsidiaries.
Moreover, failure to comply with the various foreign exchange registration requirements
described above could result in liability under PRC law for circumventing applicable foreign
exchange restrictions.
