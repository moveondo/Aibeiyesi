“AUC”

“AUC0-inf”

a form of arthritis that primarily affects the spine,
although other joints can become involved. It causes
inflammation of the spinal joints (vertebrae) that can lead
to severe, chronic pain and discomfort. In more advanced
cases this inflammation can lead to ankylosis-new bone
formation in the spine-causing sections of the spine to
fuse in a fixed, immobile position

programmed cell death

an analysis done to determine (1) the presence of a
substance and the amount of that substance and (2) the
biological or pharmacological potency of a drug

the area under the curve, a measure of how much of a
drug is in a patient’s system over a given time period. In
order to calculate the AUC, both the AUC0-t and the
AUC0-inf must be calculated

area under the concentration-time curve from the first
time point measured (0) extrapolated to infinity (inf)
