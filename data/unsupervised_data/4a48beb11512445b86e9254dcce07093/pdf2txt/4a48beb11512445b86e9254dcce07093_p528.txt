SUMMARY OF THE CONSTITUTION OF THE
COMPANY AND CAYMAN COMPANIES LAW

2.20 Procedure on liquidation

If the Company shall be wound up, and the assets available for distribution amongst the
members of the Company as such shall be insufficient to repay the whole of the paid-up capital,
such assets shall be distributed so that, as nearly as may be, the losses shall be borne by the
members of the Company in proportion to the capital paid up, or which ought to have been paid
up, at the commencement of the winding up on the shares held by them respectively. If in a
winding up the assets available for distribution amongst the members of the Company shall be
more than sufficient to repay the whole of the capital paid up at the commencement of the
winding up, the excess shall be distributed amongst the members of the Company in proportion
to the capital paid up at the commencement of the winding up on the shares held by them
respectively. The foregoing is without prejudice to the rights of the holders of shares issued
upon special terms and conditions.

If the Company shall be wound up, the liquidator may with the sanction of a special
resolution of the Company and any other sanction required by the Companies Law, divide
amongst the members of the Company in specie or kind the whole or any part of the assets of
the Company (whether they shall consist of property of the same kind or not) and may, for such
purpose, set such value as he deems fair upon any property to be divided as aforesaid and may
determine how such division shall be carried out as between the members or different classes
of members of the Company. The liquidator may, with the like sanction, vest the whole or any
part of such assets in trustees upon such trusts for the benefit of the members of the Company
as the liquidator, with the like sanction and subject to the Companies Law, shall think fit, but
so that no member of the Company shall be compelled to accept any assets, shares or other
securities in respect of which there is a liability.

2.21 Untraceable members

The Company shall be entitled to sell any shares of a member of the Company or the
shares to which a person is entitled by virtue of transmission on death or bankruptcy or
operation of law if: (a) all cheques or warrants, not being less than three in number, for any
sums payable in cash to the holder of such shares have remained uncashed for a period of 12
years; (b) the Company has not during that time or before the expiry of the three month period
referred to in (d) below received any indication of the whereabouts or existence of the member;
(c) during the 12 year period, at least three dividends in respect of the shares in question have
become payable and no dividend during that period has been claimed by the member; and (d)
upon expiry of the 12 year period, the Company has caused an advertisement to be published
in the newspapers or subject to the Listing Rules, by electronic communication in the manner
in which notices may be served by the Company by electronic means as provided in the Articles
of Association, giving notice of its intention to sell such shares and a period of three months
has elapsed since such advertisement and the Stock Exchange has been notified of such
intention. The net proceeds of any such sale shall belong to the Company and upon receipt by
the Company of such net proceeds it shall become indebted to the former member for an
amount equal to such net proceeds.
