Increasing Affordability – Chinese resident average disposable income has grown rapidly,
increasing from US$2,976.3 in 2013 to US$3,844.1 in 2017. This trend is expected to continue,
enhancing the willingness and ability of patients to pay for medications. In 2017, households
with annual disposable income of over US$20,000 accounted for 44.3% of the total households
in China and are expected to increase to 88.0% of the total households in China by 2025.
Households with annual disposable income of over US$30,000 accounted for 28.6% of the total
households in China in 2017 and are expected to increase to 65.0% of the total households in
China by 2025. As more Chinese households have more spending power, they can afford more
expensive medical treatments, particularly for life-threatening diseases. In addition, the latest
version of the NRDL was updated in 2017 when pricing negotiation was adopted for the first
time. A total of 12 innovative biologics are included as List B drugs. Such inclusion is expected
to be implemented in a regular manner, suggesting that more biologics are expected to be
covered by the NRDL in the future, further increasing the affordability of biologics in China.
As biologics become increasingly affordable to the general public, they will be used more
commonly as a treatment for oncology and auto-immune diseases. As a result, the market size
of the biologics industry in China is expected to continue to grow.

Potential Off-Label Use – Off-label drug use refers to the use of pharmaceutical drugs for
an unapproved indication. Many biologics approved in the United States are expected to be
initially approved in China for limited indications. The physicians in China may choose to
prescribe these drugs to patients based on indications approved and clinical studies performed
overseas. In indications where there were no approved drugs or for patients who have
exhausted standard treatments, drugs may be used off-label and generate additional market
growth.
