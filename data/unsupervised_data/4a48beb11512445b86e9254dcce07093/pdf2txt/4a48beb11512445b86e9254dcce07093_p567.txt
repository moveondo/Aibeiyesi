APPENDIX IV

STATUTORY AND GENERAL INFORMATION

The Option Scheme Mandate Limit may be refreshed at any time by obtaining prior
approval of our Shareholders in general meeting and/or such other requirements prescribed
under the Listing Rules from time to time. However, the refreshed Option Scheme Mandate
Limit cannot exceed 10% of the Shares in issue as at the date of such approval. Options
previously granted under the Post-IPO ESOP and any other share option schemes of our
Company (and to which provisions of Chapter 17 of the Listing Rules are applicable)
(including those outstanding, cancelled or lapsed in accordance with its terms or exercised),
shall not be counted for the purpose of calculating the refreshed Option Scheme Mandate
Limit.

Our Company may also grant options in excess of the Option Scheme Mandate Limit,
provided such grant is to specifically identified selected participant and is first approved by
Shareholders in general meeting.

(d) Maximum entitlement of a grantee

Unless approved by our Shareholders, the total number of Shares issued and to be issued
upon exercise of the options granted and to be granted under the Post-IPO ESOP and any other
share option scheme(s) of the Company to each selected participant (including both exercised
and outstanding options) in any 12-month period shall not exceed 1% of the total number of
Shares in issue (the “Individual Limit”). Any further grant of options to a selected participant
which would result in the aggregate number of Shares issued and to be issued upon exercise
of all options granted and to be granted to such selected participant (including exercised,
cancelled and outstanding options) in the 12 month period up to and including the date of such
further grant exceeding the Individual Limit shall be subject to separate approval of our
Shareholders (with such selected participant and his associates abstaining from voting). The
number and terms (including the exercise price) of options to be granted to such participant
must be fixed before Shareholders’ approval and the date of Board meeting for proposing such
further grant should be taken as the date for the purpose of calculating the exercise price
pursuant to LR17.03(9).

(e) Performance target

The Post-IPO ESOP does not set out any performance targets that must be achieved before
the options may be exercised. However, the Board or its delegate(s) may at their sole discretion
specify, as part of the terms and conditions of any option, such performance conditions that
must be satisfied before the option can be exercised.

(f)

Subscription price

The amount payable for each Share to be subscribed for under an option (“Subscription
Price”) in the event of the option being exercised shall be determined by the Board but shall
be not less than the greater of:

(i)

the closing price of a Share as stated in the daily quotations sheet issued by the Stock
Exchange on the date of grant;
