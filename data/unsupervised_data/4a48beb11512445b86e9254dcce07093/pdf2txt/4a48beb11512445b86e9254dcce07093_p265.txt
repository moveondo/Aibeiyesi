The results of our studies also demonstrate the similarity in the PK profiles between
IBI-301 and rituximab (MabThera/Rituxan). As shown in the figure below,
there are no
statistical differences in drug concentration between IBI-301 dosed animals and rituximab
(MabThera/Rituxan) dosed animals at the same time points throughout the study. These results
indicate the similarity in the PK profile between IBI-301 and rituximab (MabThera/Rituxan).

Step 3: Clinical Pharmacology Study

Our IND application for IBI-301 was approved by the NMPA in September 2014 in
accordance with the biosimilar regulatory development pathway based on the demonstrated
similarity to the reference product in the CMC and pre-clinical studies. We are conducting a
multi-center clinical trial to assess PK/PD, safety, tolerance and immunogenicity of IBI-301 in
CD20 positive B-cell
lymphoma patients who obtained complete remission or uncertain
complete remission after the prior therapy. The primary endpoints of this study are AUC0-inf
(the area under the curve from zero to infinity, which is the definite integral in a plot of drug
concentration in blood plasma vs. time) and AUC0-t. As of June 7, 2018, 160 patients at 15 trial
sites are enrolled in the trial and 142 of these patients have completed trial procedures. We
expect to complete this clinical pharmacology study in the second quarter of 2019.

We have not seen unexpected adverse events with IBI-301 in this study. Safety data from
these small and short clinical pharmacology studies aimed at establishing bioequivalence are
not useful, representative or material. The useful or material safety data set only comes from
the large and lengthy clinical confirmation studies at Step 4.
