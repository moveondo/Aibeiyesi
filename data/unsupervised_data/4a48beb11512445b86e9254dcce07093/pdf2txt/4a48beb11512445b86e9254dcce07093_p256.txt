Current Development Status and Data

Step 1: CMC and Analytical Characterization

We have developed, manufactured and characterized a master cell bank and demonstrated
its quality and stability in accordance with the ICH guidelines. We have also completed
development of a stable and controllable production process for IBI-305 and demonstrated
through comprehensive studies that the stability of drug substance and drug product comply
with the requirements of clinical research.

We completed extensive analytical characterization and in vitro studies comparing

IBI-305 to the reference product Avastin.

We have confirmed through Lys-C peptide mapping that the amino acid sequence of
IBI-305 is identical to that of the reference product Avastin, which is required for the biosimilar
pathway under NMPA regulations. The graph below shows the peptide fingerprint of IBI-305
compared with Avastin. IBI-305 and Avastin were fragmented by endoproteinase Lys-C
degradation
chromatography-mass
spectroscopy/mass spectroscopy (LC-MS/MS). This technology creates a peptide fragment-
based fingerprint for proteins. If the fingerprints are identical, it can be inferred that two
proteins have identical amino acid primary structure.

The peptide fingerprint of IBI-305 is highly similar to bevacizumab (Avastin)

A cell-based potency assay demonstrated that IBI-305 and Avastin have similar in vitro
potency. As shown in the left hand panel of the following figure, when increasing concentration
of IBI-305 and Avastin are incubated in the reporter assay, both antibodies block VEGF
induced activation of the reporter gene with identical potency. The right hand panel of the
following figure demonstrates that multiple lots of IBI-305 and Avastin have similar potency.
