The following chart illustrates the four main functions of our fully-integrated platform.

Drug Discovery and Pre-clinical Development

This aspect of our fully-integrated platform is focused on the discovery and pre-clinical
development of new drug candidates. We have discovered 12 drug candidates which are
currently in various stages of development, including three discovered solely by ourselves (i.e.,
IBI-307, IBI-322 and IBI-323) and the other nine discovered in collaboration with our partners
(i.e., sintilimab, IBI-306, IBI-101, IBI-188, IBI-110, IBI-939, IBI-318, IBI-319 and IBI-315).

We use various antibody discovery and engineering technologies, either independently or
in collaboration with third parties, to generate novel mono-specific or bi-specific antibodies,
evaluate their potential efficacy and eventually determine whether the antibodies can be further
developed as therapeutics. The four major approaches we use to generate mono-specific
antibodies or engineer bi-specific antibodies are summarized below:

Hybridoma technology: We first generate a mouse antibody through immunization
of mice with the target antigen. We then convert the mouse antibody into an antibody
with characteristics that mimic a human antibody through a process called
humanization.

Fully humanized mouse: We licensed mice with a human immune system from
third-party developers of human antibody discovery platforms, including Trianni,
Inc. and Harbour Antibodies. These mouse strains can be used to discover potential
human monoclonal antibody drug candidates. See “– Raw Materials and Suppliers”
for more information on the mice strains we use to discover drug candidates.

Phage display: We use a protein target to screen monoclonal antibodies from our
own proprietary human synthetic antibody library (also called a phage library). Such
process is called phage display.
