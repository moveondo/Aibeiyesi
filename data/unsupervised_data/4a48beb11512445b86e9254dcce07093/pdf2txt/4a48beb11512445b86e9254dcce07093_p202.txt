HISTORY, DEVELOPMENT AND CORPORATE STRUCTURE

OVERVIEW

Our Company was incorporated as an exempted company with limited liability in the
Cayman Islands on April 28, 2011 as the holding company of our businesses. Leveraging our
platform, we have built up a pipeline of 17 antibody drug candidates in the last seven years,
led by our four core products that are in late-stage clinical development in China, including
sintilimab (IBI-308), our novel PD-1 antibody; IBI-305, our bevacizumab (Avastin) biosimilar;
IBI-301, our
rituximab (MabThera/Rituxan) biosimilar; and IBI-303, our adalimumab
(Humira) biosimilar. For more information on our drug candidates, please refer to the section
headed “Business.”

In 2015, we entered into a strategic partnership with Eli Lilly to co-develop and
co-commercialize antibody drugs including sintilimab. This strategic partnership marked the
first time a monoclonal antibody drug product invented by a Chinese company was licensed to
a global pharmaceutical company.

Our leader, Dr. De-Chao Michael Yu, has more than twenty years of industry and
managerial experience in American and Chinese biopharmaceutical companies. Dr. Yu is an
entrepreneur and inventor of over 60 patents. He invented the world’s first oncolytic
virus-based immunotherapeutic product, Oncorine, and also co-invented and led the
development of the first domestic innovative fully human antibody-like therapeutic approved
for marketing in China, Conbercept. Dr. Yu is also an expert adviser to the NMPA.
