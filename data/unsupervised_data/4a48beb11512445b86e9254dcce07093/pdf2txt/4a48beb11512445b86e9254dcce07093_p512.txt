APPENDIX III

SUMMARY OF THE CONSTITUTION OF THE
COMPANY AND CAYMAN COMPANIES LAW

(b) Power to dispose of the assets of the Company or any subsidiary

The management of the business of the Company shall be vested in the Directors
who, in addition to the powers and authorities by the Articles of Association expressly
conferred upon them, may exercise all such powers and do all such acts and things as may
be exercised or done or approved by the Company and are not by the Articles of
Association or the Companies Law expressly directed or required to be exercised or done
by the Company in general meeting, but subject nevertheless to the provisions of the
Companies Law and of the Articles of Association and to any regulation from time to time
made by the Company in general meeting not being inconsistent with such provisions or
the Articles of Association, provided that no regulation so made shall invalidate any prior
act of the Directors which would have been valid if such regulation had not been made.

(c) Compensation or payment for loss of office

Payment to any Director or past Director of any sum by way of compensation for
loss of office or as consideration for or in connection with his retirement from office (not
being a payment to which the Director is contractually entitled) must first be approved by
the Company in general meeting.

(d) Loans to Directors

There are provisions in the Articles of Association prohibiting the making of loans
to Directors or their respective close associates which are equivalent to the restrictions
imposed by the Companies Ordinance.

(e) Financial assistance to purchase Shares

Subject

to all applicable laws,

the Company may give financial assistance to
Directors and employees of the Company, its subsidiaries or any holding company or any
subsidiary of such holding company in order that they may buy shares in the Company
or any such subsidiary or holding company. Further, subject to all applicable laws, the
Company may give financial assistance to a trustee for the acquisition of shares in the
Company or shares in any such subsidiary or holding company to be held for the benefit
of employees of the Company, its subsidiaries, any holding company of the Company or
any subsidiary of any such holding company (including salaried Directors).
