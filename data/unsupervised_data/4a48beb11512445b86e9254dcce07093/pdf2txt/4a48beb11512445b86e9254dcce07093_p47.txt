GLOSSARY OF TECHNICAL TERMS

antibody that combines two antigen-recognizing elements
into a single construct, able to bind to two different
antigens at the same time

biologic license application

a part of the complement protein known as complement
component 3

a cancer that begins in the lining layer (epithelial cells) of
organs

a transmembrane glycoprotein that serves as a co-
receptor for the T-cell receptor

a proximate measure of blockade of PD-1 action in
tumors, which is the ratio of cytotoxic T lymphocytes
(CD8) to Treg lymphocytes. An increase in the CD8/Treg
ratio is a beneficial change in the immune status within
the tumors

a cell surface protein widely expressed on immune
system B cells

cluster of differentiation 47, also known as integrin
associated protein (IAP), a membrane protein which
provides a “do not eat me” signal to macrophages

a transmembrane glycoprotein in the immunoglobulin
superfamily

complement-dependent cytotoxicity

a population of cells which descend from a single cell and
contain the same genetic makeup, thereby producing the
same proteins. The productivity of a cell line determines
the cost of manufacturing and the quality of a cell line is
directly related to the quality of the relevant biologics

technique used in laboratories to break open cells and
purify or further study their contents. Lysis refers to the
breaking down of the membrane of a cell, often by viral,
enzymic, or osmotic mechanisms that compromise its
integrity
