APPENDIX III

SUMMARY OF THE CONSTITUTION OF THE
COMPANY AND CAYMAN COMPANIES LAW

(h) Retirement, appointment and removal

The Directors shall have power at any time and from time to time to appoint any
person to be a Director, either to fill a casual vacancy or as an addition to the existing
Directors. Any Director so appointed shall hold office only until the next general meeting
of the Company and shall then be eligible for re-election at that meeting.

The Company may by ordinary resolution remove any Director (including a
Managing Director or other executive Director) before the expiration of his period of
office notwithstanding anything in the Articles of Association or in any agreement
between the Company and such Director (but without prejudice to any claim for
compensation or damages payable to him in respect of the termination of his appointment
as Director or of any other appointment of office as a result of the termination of this
appointment as Director). The Company may by ordinary resolution appoint another
person in his place. Any Director so appointed shall hold office during such time only as
the Director in whose place he is appointed would have held the same if he had not been
removed. The Company may also by ordinary resolution elect any person to be a Director,
either to fill a casual vacancy or as an addition to the existing Directors. Any Director so
appointed shall hold office only until the next following general meeting of the Company
and shall then be eligible for re-election but shall not be taken into account in determining
the Directors who are to retire by rotation at such meeting. No person shall, unless
recommended by the Directors, be eligible for election to the office of Director at any
general meeting unless, during the period, which shall be at least seven days, commencing
no earlier than the day after the despatch of the notice of the meeting appointed for such
election and ending no later than seven days prior to the date of such meeting, there has
been given to the Secretary of the Company notice in writing by a member of the
Company (not being the person to be proposed) entitled to attend and vote at the meeting
for which such notice is given of his intention to propose such person for election and also
notice in writing signed by the person to be proposed of his willingness to be elected.

There is no shareholding qualification for Directors nor is there any specified age

limit for Directors.

The office of a Director shall be vacated:

(i)

(ii)

if he resigns his office by notice in writing to the Company at its registered
office or its principal office in Hong Kong;

if an order is made by any competent court or official on the grounds that he
is or may be suffering from mental disorder or is otherwise incapable of
managing his affairs and the Directors resolve that his office be vacated;

(iii) if, without

leave, he is absent from meetings of the Directors (unless an
alternate Director appointed by him attends) for 12 consecutive months, and
the Directors resolve that his office be vacated;
