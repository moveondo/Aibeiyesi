The following figure shows the basic process flow of the formulation and fill/finish

We operate our manufacturing facilities on our main campus in Suzhou that are designed
to comply with both Chinese and international drug manufacturing standards. From our
inception, we have focused on constructing and operating manufacturing facilities that are
designed to meet rigorous international good manufacturing practice (GMP) standards. We
have undergone ordinary course, comprehensive annual audits of our production facility to
evaluate compliance with industry GMP and quality compliance standards.

Manufacturing Building 1: Our Manufacturing Building 1 has 21,579.52 m2 of floor
space and currently houses our first stage production facilities with three 1,000L
disposable bioreactors. These facilities produce the drugs that we use for clinical
trials. We expect our existing facilities to be able to support our commercial
manufacturing needs for our first two products, namely sintilimab and, subject to the
speed of the regulatory review process, either IBI-303 or IBI-305, through 2020.
