RISK FACTORS

Our business will depend on the successful development, regulatory approval and
commercialization of our drug candidates for the treatment of patients with cancer or other
targeted indications, all of which are still in pre-clinical or clinical development, and other new
drug candidates we may identify and develop. We have invested a significant portion of our
efforts and financial resources in the development of our existing drug candidates and in the
research of new drug candidates. The success of the development of our drug candidate
pipeline will depend on several factors, including:

obtaining sufficient supplies of any competitor drug products that may be necessary
for use in clinical trials for evaluation of our drug candidates;

favorable safety and efficacy data from our clinical trials and other studies;

successful identification of potential product candidates based on our research or
business development methodology or search criteria and process;

sufficient resources to acquire or discover additional drug candidates;

receipt of regulatory approvals;

we may retain to conduct clinical trials, of their duties to us in a manner that
complies with our protocols and applicable laws and that protects the integrity of the
resulting data;

obtaining and maintaining patent,
protection and regulatory exclusivity for our drug candidates;

trade secret and other intellectual property

ensuring we do not infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate the patents, trade
secrets or other intellectual property rights of third parties;

if and when

obtaining and maintaining favorable reimbursement from third-party payors for
drugs, if and when approved;
