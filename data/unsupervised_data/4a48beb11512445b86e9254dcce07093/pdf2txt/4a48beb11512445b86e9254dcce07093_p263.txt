Current Development Status and Data

Step 1: CMC and Analytical Characterization

We have developed, manufactured and characterized a master cell bank and demonstrated
its quality and stability in accordance with the ICH guidelines. We have also completed
development of a stable and controllable production process for IBI-301 and demonstrated
through comprehensive studies that the stability of drug substance and drug product comply
with the requirements of clinical research.

We completed extensive analytical characterization and in vitro studies comparing

IBI-301 to Rituxan.

We have confirmed through Lys-C peptide mapping that the amino acid sequence of
IBI-301 is identical to that of the reference product (MabThera/Rituxan), which is required for
the biosimilar pathway under NMPA regulations. The graph below shows peptide fingerprint
of IBI-301 compared with Rituxan. IBI-301 and Rituxan were fragmented by endoproteinase
Lys-C degradation and the peptides were separated by liquid chromatography-mass
spectroscopy/mass spectroscopy (LC-MS/MS). This technology creates a peptide fragment-
based fingerprint for proteins. If the fingerprints are identical it can be inferred that two
proteins have identical amino acid primary structure.

The peptide fingerprint of IBI-301 is highly similar to Rituxan
