SUMMARY OF THE CONSTITUTION OF THE
COMPANY AND CAYMAN COMPANIES LAW

2.9 Accounts and audit

The Directors shall cause to be kept such books of account as are necessary to give a true
and fair view of the state of the Company’s affairs and to show and explain its transactions and
otherwise in accordance with the Companies Law.

The Directors shall from time to time determine whether, and to what extent, and at what
times and places and under what conditions or regulations, the accounts and books of the
Company, or any of them, shall be open to the inspection by members of the Company (other
than officers of the Company) and no such member shall have any right of inspecting any
accounts or books or documents of the Company except as conferred by the Companies Law
or any other relevant law or regulation or as authorised by the Directors or by the Company
in general meeting.

The Directors shall, commencing with the first annual general meeting, cause to be
prepared and to be laid before the members of the Company at every annual general meeting
a profit and loss account for the period, in the case of the first account, since the incorporation
of the Company and, in any other case, since the preceding account, together with a balance
sheet as at the date to which the profit and loss account is made up and a Director’s report with
respect to the profit or loss of the Company for the period covered by the profit and loss
account and the state of the Company’s affairs as at the end of such period, an auditor’s report
on such accounts and such other reports and accounts as may be required by law. Copies of
those documents to be laid before the members of the Company at an annual general meeting
shall not less than 21 days before the date of the meeting, be sent in the manner in which
notices may be served by the Company as provided in the Articles of Association to every
member of the Company and every holder of debentures of the Company provided that the
Company shall not be required to send copies of those documents to any person of whose
address the Company is not aware or to more than one of the joint holders of any shares or
debentures.

The Company shall at every annual general meeting appoint an auditor or auditors of the
Company who shall hold office until the next annual general meeting. The remuneration of the
auditors shall be fixed by the Company at the annual general meeting at which they are
appointed provided that in respect of any particular year the Company in general meeting may
delegate the fixing of such remuneration to the Directors.
