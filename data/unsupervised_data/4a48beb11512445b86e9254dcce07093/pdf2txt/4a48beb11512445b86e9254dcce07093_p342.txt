FINANCIAL INFORMATION

RMB0.4 million of receivables due from directors as of December 31, 2016 and 2017
represents the subscription receivables for share options due from Dr. Yu. RMB71.9 million of
receivables due from directors and an employee as of June 30, 2018 represents the amounts of
the exercise price and other costs payable by the directors and an employee who have
accelerated their options. It is expected that such amount owed by our directors and an
employee will be settled prior to the consummation of the Global Offering.

We recorded subscription receivables for preferred shares of RMB1,504.0 million as of
June 30, 2018, relating to the preferred shares issued to certain onshore PRC investors. As of
August 31, 2018, such subscription receivables related to preferred shares have been fully paid,
leading to the significant decrease of our deposit, prepayment and other receivables from June
30, 2018 to August 31, 2018. We also recorded other loans of RMB21.1 million as of June 30,
2018, which include loans provided to certain employees for financing their payment on
exercising the share options and individual income tax.

We recorded capitalized listing expenses as deferred issue costs. We recorded RMB6.3

million of deferred issue costs as of June 30, 2018.

Other tax recoverables are VAT recoverables. As we have not commercialized any of our
drug candidates, the VAT recoverables primarily related to the VAT we paid for machines and
equipment, goods and services we purchased which are expected to offset any VAT incurred
once we start selling the drugs after their commercialization. We are able to carry the VAT
recoverables forward for an infinite period of time.

Other Financial Assets

Our financial assets mandatorily measured at fair value through profit and loss primarily
consist of wealth management plans managed by major state-owned commercial banks in
China. Such wealth management plans come with an anticipated return rate ranging from 2.3%
to 5.1% and mature within one year. As of June 30, 2018, more than 70% of such wealth
management plans guarantee repayment of principal. We believe that purchase of these wealth
management plans is in line with our treasury functions and are not speculative in nature.

Other financial assets increased by RMB27.2 million to RMB809.5 million as of
December 31, 2017 from RMB782.3 million as of December 31, 2016. The increase was
primarily attributable to purchase of additional wealth management plans by using a portion of
the proceeds from our Series D equity financing. Other
financial assets decreased by
RMB628.1 million to RMB181.4 million as of June 30, 2018, from RMB809.5 million as of
December 31, 2017, primarily due to reduced purchases of wealth management products based
on our adjusted cash management policy. We have a risk management policy and internal
control procedures and guidelines in place which we believe are effective in identifying the
risks associated with investing in wealth management plans,
including those that do not
guarantee repayment of principal, and we have strictly adhered to such policies and guidelines.
