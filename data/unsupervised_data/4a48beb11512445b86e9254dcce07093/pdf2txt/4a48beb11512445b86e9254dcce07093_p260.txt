According to the prescribing information of Avastin, the most common adverse
reactions observed in patients receiving Avastin as a single agent or in combination with
chemotherapy at a rate > 10%, are epistaxis, headache, hypertension, rhinitis, proteinuria,
taste alteration, dry skin,

patients because of adverse reactions.

rectal hemorrhage,

The safety of Avastin was evaluated as first-line treatment in 422 patients with
unresectable NSCLC who received at least one dose of Avastin in an active-controlled,
open-label, multicenter trial. Only Grade 3-5 non hematologic and Grade 4-5 hematologic
adverse reactions were collected. Grade 3-5 non hematologic and Grade 4-5 hematologic
adverse reactions occurring at a higher incidence (ⱖ 2%) in patients receiving Avastin
with paclitaxel and carboplatin compared with patients receiving chemotherapy alone
were neutropenia (27% vs. 17%), fatigue (16% vs. 13%), hypertension (8% vs. 0.7%),
infection without neutropenia (7% vs. 3%), venous thromboembolism (5% vs. 3%),
febrile neutropenia (5% vs. 2%), pneumonitis/pulmonary infiltrates (5% vs. 3%),
infection with Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia (4% vs. 2%), hyponatremia (4% vs. 1%),
headache (3% vs. 1%) and proteinuria (3% vs. 0%).

Licenses, Rights and Obligations

We obtained CHO cell line that expresses IBI-305 from Suzhou-based Alphamab Co.
Ltd., or Alphamab. We currently have no material further monetary obligations to Alphamab
with respect to IBI-305.

WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ULTIMATELY DEVELOP AND MARKET IBI-305
SUCCESSFULLY.

IBI-301 is our biosimilar product candidate to rituximab, which is sold under the trade

names MabThera (美羅華) in China and MabThera/Rituxan outside China.

Mechanism of Action

Rituximab is a recombinant chimeric monoclonal antibody that binds to the cell surface
protein CD20, which is widely expressed on immune system B-cells. Rituximab mediates
antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement-dependent cytotoxicity
(CDC), and induces programmed cell death, or apoptosis, of CD20 positive cells. These
activities result in the elimination of B-cells (including the cancerous ones) from the body.
