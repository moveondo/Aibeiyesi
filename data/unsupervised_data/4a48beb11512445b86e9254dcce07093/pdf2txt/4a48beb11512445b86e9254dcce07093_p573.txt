STATUTORY AND GENERAL INFORMATION

(s) Ranking of shares

to all

The Shares to be allotted and issued upon the exercise of an option shall be identical to
the then existing issued shares of the Company and subject
the provisions of the
memorandum and articles of association of the Company for the time being in force and will
rank pari passu with the other fully paid Shares in issue on the date the name of the grantee
is registered on the register of members of the Company or if that date falls on a day when the
register of members of the Company is closed, the first day of the re-opening of the register
of members, save that the grantee shall not have any voting rights, or rights to participate in
any dividends or distributions (including those arising on a liquidation of the Company)
declared or recommended or resolved to be paid to the Shareholders on the register on a date
prior to such registration.

(t) Duration

The Post-IPO ESOP shall be valid and effective for the period of ten years commencing
on the Listing Date (after which, no further options shall be offered or granted under the
Post-IPO ESOP), but in all other respects the provisions of the Post-IPO ESOP shall remain in
full force and effect to the extent necessary to give effect to the exercise of any options granted
prior thereto or otherwise as may be required in accordance with the provisions of the rules of
the Post-IPO ESOP.

(u) Alteration of the Post-IPO ESOP

The Board may subject to the rules of the Post-IPO ESOP amend any of the provisions
of the Post-IPO ESOP (including without limitation amendments in order to comply with
changes in legal or regulatory requirements and amendments in order to waive any restrictions,
imposed by the provisions of the Post-IPO ESOP, which are not found in Chapter 17 of the
Listing Rules) at any time (but not so as to affect adversely any rights which have accrued to
any grantee at that date).

Those specific provisions of the Post-IPO ESOP which relate to the matters set out in
Rule 17.03 of the Listing Rules cannot be altered to the advantage of selected participants, and
no changes to the authority of the administrator of the Post-IPO ESOP in relation to any
alteration of the terms of the Post-IPO ESOP shall be made, without the prior approval of
Shareholders in general meeting. Any alterations to the terms of the Post-IPO ESOP which are
of a material nature, or any change to the terms and conditions of options granted, must also,
to be effective, be approved by the Shareholders in general meeting and the Stock Exchange,
except where the alterations take effect automatically under the existing terms of the Post-IPO
ESOP. The options and the Post-IPO ESOP so altered must comply with Chapter 17 of the
Listing Rules. Any change to the authority of the Directors or scheme administrators in relation
to any alternation to the terms of the Post-IPO ESOP must be approved by Shareholders in
general meeting.
