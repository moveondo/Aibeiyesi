Based on Francisco, Loise M., Peter T. Sage, and Arlene H. Sharpe. “The PD-1 Pathway in Tolerance and
Autoimmunity.” Immunological Reviews 236 (2010): 219-242. PMC. Web. 1 Aug. 2018.

Market Opportunity and Competition

We believe there is a significant commercial opportunity in China for PD-1 or PD-L1
antibody drugs. According to the Frost & Sullivan Report, the incidence of all cancers in China
increased from 3.7 million in 2013 to 4.2 million in 2017. Among all types of cancers, the
incidence of lung cancer, colorectal cancer and esophageal cancer grew the fastest during this
period. Driven by a combination of factors such as unhealthy lifestyle and pollution, it is
estimated that the incidence of all cancers in China will reach 4.8 million in 2022. Among all
types of cancers, lung, stomach, liver, colorectal, breast and esophageal cancers are the six
most common cancers in China and respectively accounted for 863,900, 454,500, 489,100,
411,100, 299,600 and 285,300 of the total incidence in China in 2017.

Currently available clinical data suggest that some of the most prevalent cancers in China,
such as lung, stomach,
liver, colorectal and esophageal cancers, are responsive to the
PD-1/PD-L1 class of drugs. Taking into account the other cancer types (such as bladder,
melanoma and kidney cancers) that are also responsive to the PD1-/PD-L1 class, the overall
annual incidence of the aforementioned eight types of cancers in China is approximately 3.0
million in 2017.

In China, according to the Frost & Sullivan Report, only two PD-1 antibodies have been
approved for marketing: Bristol-Myers Squibb’s Opdivo (nivolumab), which was approved by
the NMPA on June 15, 2018 for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC after
prior platinum-based chemotherapy in adult patients without EGFR or ALK genomic tumor
aberration, and Merck’s Keytruda (pembrolizumab), which was approved by the NMPA on July
26, 2018 for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma
