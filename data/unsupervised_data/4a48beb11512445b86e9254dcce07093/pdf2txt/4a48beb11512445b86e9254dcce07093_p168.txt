INDUSTRY OVERVIEW

(cid:129)

In clinical practice,
the same drug product (for instance, our sintilimab, upon
requisite approvals) could be prescribed for different types of cancer patients and,
therefore, the expected market size for PD-1 inhibitors and PD-L1 inhibitors cannot
be reliably or meaningfully broken down by indications.

Epidemiology of PD-1/PD-L1 Antibody Sensitive Cancers in China

According to the Frost & Sullivan Report, the incidence of all cancers in China increased
from 3.7 million in 2013 to 4.2 million in 2017, representing a CAGR of 3.4%. Driven by a
combination of factors such as unhealthy lifestyle and increasing pollution, it is estimated that
the incidence of all cancers in China will reach 4.8 million in 2022 at a CAGR of 2.6% from
2017 to 2022, and further reach 5.8 million in 2030 at a CAGR of 2.3% from 2022 to 2030.
Among all types of cancers, lung, liver, stomach, colorectal, breast and esophageal cancers are
the six cancers with the highest incidence in China and accounted for 20.6%, 11.7%, 10.8%,
9.8%, 7.1% and 6.8% of the total incidence in China in 2017, respectively. Moreover, the
incidence of lung cancer, colorectal cancer and esophagus cancer tend to grow faster than that
of other cancers in China. The incidence of non-small cell lung cancer, a sub-type of lung
cancer, increased at a CAGR of 3.5% from 0.6 million in 2013 to 0.7 million in 2017. The chart
below shows the incidence by cancer types in the periods indicated.
