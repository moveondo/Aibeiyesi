FINANCIAL INFORMATION

China

Generally, our subsidiaries in China are subject to enterprise income tax on their taxable
income in China at a rate of 25%, except that Innovent Suzhou benefits from a preferential tax
rate of 15% as it is qualified as a “High and New Technology Enterprise” in Jiangsu Province.
The enterprise income tax is calculated based on the entity’s global income as determined
under PRC tax laws and accounting standards. The related tax authorities in Jiangsu Provision
reviews the “High and New Technology Enterprise” status every three years. We expect
Innovent Suzhou to continue to qualify as a “High and New Technology Enterprise” in Jiangsu
Province for the foreseeable future.
