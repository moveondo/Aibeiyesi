SUMMARY OF THE CONSTITUTION OF THE
COMPANY AND CAYMAN COMPANIES LAW

SUMMARY OF CAYMAN ISLANDS COMPANY LAW AND TAXATION

1

Introduction

The Companies Law is derived, to a large extent, from the older Companies Acts of
England, although there are significant differences between the Companies Law and the current
Companies Act of England. Set out below is a summary of certain provisions of the Companies
Law, although this does not purport to contain all applicable qualifications and exceptions or
to be a complete review of all matters of corporate law and taxation which may differ from
equivalent provisions in jurisdictions with which interested parties may be more familiar.

Incorporation

The Company was incorporated in the Cayman Islands as an exempted company with
limited liability on April 28, 2011 under the Companies Law. As such, its operations must be
conducted mainly outside the Cayman Islands. The Company is required to file an annual
return each year with the Registrar of Companies of the Cayman Islands and pay a fee which
is based on the size of its authorised share capital.

Share Capital

The Companies Law permits a company to issue ordinary shares, preference shares,

redeemable shares or any combination thereof.

The Companies Law provides that where a company issues shares at a premium, whether
for cash or otherwise, a sum equal to the aggregate amount of the value of the premia on those
shares shall be transferred to an account called the “share premium account”. At the option of
a company, these provisions may not apply to premia on shares of that company allotted
pursuant to any arrangement in consideration of the acquisition or cancellation of shares in any
other company and issued at a premium. The Companies Law provides that the share premium
account may be applied by a company, subject to the provisions, if any, of its memorandum and
articles of association, in such manner as the company may from time to time determine
including, but without limitation:

(a)

paying distributions or dividends to members;

(b)

(c)

paying up unissued shares of the company to be issued to members as fully paid
bonus shares;

in the redemption and repurchase of shares (subject to the provisions of section 37
of the Companies Law);

(d) writing-off the preliminary expenses of the company;

(e) writing-off the expenses of, or the commission paid or discount allowed on, any

issue of shares or debentures of the company; and
