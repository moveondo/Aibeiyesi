UNDERWRITING

All such activities may occur both during and after the end of the stabilizing period
described in the section headed “Structure of the Global Offering” in this prospectus. Such
activities may affect the market price or value of the Shares, the liquidity or trading volume
in the Shares and the volatility of the price of the Shares, and the extent to which this occurs
from day to day cannot be estimated.

It should be noted that when engaging in any of these activities, the Syndicate Members

will be subject to certain restrictions, including the following:

(a)

the Syndicate Members (other than the Stabilization Manager or any person acting
for it) must not, in connection with the distribution of the Offer Shares, effect any
transactions (including issuing or entering into any option or other derivative
transactions relating to the Offer Shares), whether in the open market or otherwise,
with a view to stabilizing or maintaining the market price of any of the Offer Shares
at levels other than those which might otherwise prevail in the open market; and

(b)

the Syndicate Members must comply with all applicable laws and regulations,
including the market misconduct provisions of the SFO, including the provisions
prohibiting insider dealing,
false trading, price rigging and stock market
manipulation.

Certain of the Syndicate Members or their respective affiliates have provided from time
to time, and expect to provide in the future, investment banking and other services to the
Company and each of its affiliates for which such Syndicate Members or their respective
affiliates have received or will receive customary fees and commissions.

In addition, the Syndicate Members or their respective affiliates may provide financing to

investors to finance their subscriptions of Offer Shares in the Global Offering.
