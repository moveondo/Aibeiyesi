China’s monoclonal antibodies (including fusion proteins) market only accounted for
5.3% of China’s overall biologics market, compared with a 43.2% market share of mAbs in the
global biologics market in 2017. Until 2017, there were only 26 approved mAbs in China,
compared with 70 approved mAbs in the United States. According to the Frost & Sullivan
Report, with the inclusion of more mAbs into the NRDL, the sales revenue of China’s mAbs
market is expected to grow to RMB69.6 billion in 2022, representing a CAGR of 42.6% from
2017 to 2022, and further grow to RMB191.2 billion in 2030, representing a CAGR of 13.5%
from 2022 to 2030, outpacing that of China’s overall biologics market in the respective period.
The diagram below summarizes the market size of China’s mAbs market from 2013 to 2017
and the estimated market size of China’s mAbs market from 2018 to 2030.
