APPENDIX III

SUMMARY OF THE CONSTITUTION OF THE
COMPANY AND CAYMAN COMPANIES LAW

In the case of joint registered holders of any share, any one of such persons may vote at
any meeting, either personally or by proxy, in respect of such share as if he were solely entitled
thereto; but if more than one of such joint holders be present at any meeting personally or by
proxy, that one of the said persons so present being the most or, as the case may be, the more
senior shall alone be entitled to vote in respect of the relevant joint holding and, for this
purpose, seniority shall be determined by reference to the order in which the names of the joint
holders stand on the register in respect of the relevant joint holding.

A member of the Company in respect of whom an order has been made by any competent
court or official on the grounds that he is or may be suffering from mental disorder or is
otherwise incapable of managing his affairs may vote by any person authorised in such
circumstances to do so and such person may vote by proxy.

Save as expressly provided in the Articles of Association or as otherwise determined by
the Directors, no person other than a member of the Company duly registered and who shall
have paid all sums for the time being due from him payable to the Company in respect of his
shares shall be entitled to be present or to vote (save as proxy for another member of the
Company), or to be reckoned in a quorum, either personally or by proxy at any general
meeting.

At any general meeting a resolution put to the vote of the meeting shall be decided by way
of a poll save that the chairman of the meeting may allow a resolution which relates purely to
a procedural or administrative matter as prescribed under the Listing Rules to be voted on by
a show of hands.

If a recognised clearing house (or its nominee(s)) is a member of the Company it may
authorise such person or persons as it thinks fit to act as its proxy(ies) or representative(s) at
any general meeting of the Company or at any general meeting of any class of members of the
Company provided that, if more than one person is so authorised, the authorisation shall
specify the number and class of shares in respect of which each such person is so authorised.
A person authorised pursuant to this provision shall be entitled to exercise the same rights and
powers on behalf of the recognised clearing house (or its nominee(s)) which he represents as
that recognised clearing house (or its nominee(s)) could exercise as if it were an individual
member of
the Company holding the number and class of shares specified in such
authorisation, including, where a show of hands is allowed, the right to vote individually on
a show of hands.

2.8 Annual general meetings

The Company shall hold a general meeting as its annual general meeting each year, within
a period of not more than 15 months after the holding of the last preceding annual general
meeting (or such longer period as the Stock Exchange may authorise). The annual general
meeting shall be specified as such in the notices calling it.
