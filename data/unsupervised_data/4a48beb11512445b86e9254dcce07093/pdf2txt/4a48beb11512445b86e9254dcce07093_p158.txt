Such gap indicates that China lags far behind developed countries in terms of cancer
treatments available but on the other hand demonstrates a huge potential for China’s biologics
market.

Increasing Investment

in Biologics – The pharmaceutical

industry, especially the
biologics industry, is capital-intensive and requires heavy investment both in research and
development and manufacturing facilities. Capital
in China’s pharmaceutical
industry in 2017 was US$24.9 billion, the majority of which has been invested in biotech
companies that focus on the development of biologics. Also, thousands of highly-skilled,
overseas-educated biotech talent return to China every year, bringing the knowledge necessary
to manufacture biologics and biosimilars and helping to narrow the technological gap between
multinational companies and local competitors.

Favorable Policies – The PRC government has established a set of regulations and
policies to support the development of China’s biologics market. Notably, in October 2017, the
General Office of the CPC Central Committee and the General Office of the State Council
issued the Opinions on Deepening the Reform of the Evaluation and Approval Systems and
Encouraging Innovation on Drugs and Medical Devices (《關於深化審評審批制度改革鼓勵藥
品醫療器械創新的意見》), which aims to improve the regulatory regime for the biologics
industry,
the
competitiveness of the biologics industry. With respect to biosimilars, the NMPA issued the
Biosimilars Guideline in 2015, which outlines the regulatory framework for biosimilars. See
“Regulations” for more information. Also, as a result of the series of favorable policies, NMPA
has accelerated the review and approval process for innovative drugs. From 2013 to 2017, the
biologics NDAs approved by NMPA increased from 6 to 29, and the biologics INDs approved
increased from 78 to 227. Among all the biologics INDs approved, oncology candidates
accounted for the largest proportion, with a share of 41.7%. The biologics INDs and NDAs
