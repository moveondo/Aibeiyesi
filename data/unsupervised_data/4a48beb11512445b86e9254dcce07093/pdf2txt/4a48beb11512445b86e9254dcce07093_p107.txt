the diversion of our management’s attention from our existing product programs and
initiatives in pursuing such a strategic merger or acquisition;

retention of key employees, the loss of key personnel, and uncertainties in our
ability to maintain key business relationships;

risks and uncertainties associated with the other party to such a transaction,
including the prospects of that party and their existing drugs or drug candidates and
regulatory approvals; and

our
inability to generate revenue from acquired technology and/or products
sufficient to meet our objectives in undertaking the acquisition or even to offset the
associated acquisition and maintenance costs.

In addition, if we undertake acquisitions, we may issue dilutive securities, assume or
incur debt obligations, incur large one-time expenses and acquire intangible assets that could
result in significant future amortization expense.

PRC regulations and rules concerning mergers and acquisitions,

including the
Regulations on Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Companies by Foreign Investors, or the
M&A Rules, and other recently adopted regulations and rules with respect to mergers and

involves factors that have or may have impact on the national economic security, or (iii) such
transaction will lead to a change in control of a domestic enterprise which holds a famous
trademark or PRC time-honored brand. Moreover, according to the Anti-Monopoly Law of
PRC and the Provisions on Thresholds

business undertakings by way of mergers, acquisitions or contractual arrangements that allow
one market player to take control of or to exert decisive impact on another market player must
also be notified in advance to the MOFCOM when the threshold is crossed and such
concentration shall not be implemented without the clearance of prior notification. In addition,
the Regulations on Implementation of Security Review System for the Merger and Acquisition
of Domestic Enterprise by Foreign Lenders, or the Security Review Rules, issued by the
MOFCOM specify that mergers and acquisitions by foreign investors that raise “national

attempting to bypass a security review by structuring the transaction through, among other
