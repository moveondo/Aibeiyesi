RISK FACTORS

The regulatory approval processes of the NMPA, U.S. Food and Drug Administration,
European Medicines Agency and other comparable regulatory authorities are lengthy,
time-consuming and inherently unpredictable. If we are ultimately unable to obtain
regulatory approval for our drug candidates, our business will be substantially harmed.

The time required to obtain approval by the NMPA,

the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration, or FDA, the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, and other comparable
regulatory authorities is unpredictable but typically takes 10-15 years (according to PhRMA
Key Facts 2016) following the commencement of pre-clinical studies and clinical trials and
depends on numerous factors, including the substantial discretion of the regulatory authorities.

Our drug candidates could fail

to receive regulatory approval

for many reasons,

failure to begin or complete clinical trials due to disagreements with regulatory
authorities;

failure to demonstrate that a drug candidate is safe and effective for its proposed
indication;

failure of clinical trial results to meet the level of statistical significance required for
approval;

data integrity issues related to our clinical trials;

disagreement with our interpretation of data from pre-clinical studies or clinical
trials;

changes in approval policies or regulations that render our pre-clinical and clinical
data insufficient for approval or require us to amend our clinical trial protocols;

regulatory requests for additional analyses, reports, data, non-clinical studies and
clinical trials, or questions regarding interpretations of data and results and the
emergence of new information regarding our drug candidates;

our failure to conduct a clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or
our clinical trial protocols; and

clinical sites, investigators or other participants in our clinical trials deviating from
a trial protocol,
in accordance with regulatory
requirements, or dropping out of a trial.

failing to conduct

the trial

The NMPA, FDA, EMA or a comparable regulatory authority may require more
information, including additional pre-clinical or clinical data, to support approval, which may
delay or prevent approval and our commercialization plans, or we may decide to abandon the
development program.
