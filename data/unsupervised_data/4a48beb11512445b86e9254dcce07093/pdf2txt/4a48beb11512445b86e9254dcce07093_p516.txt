COMPANY AND CAYMAN COMPANIES LAW

(iv)

if he becomes bankrupt or has a receiving order made against him or suspends
payment or compounds with his creditors generally;

(v)

if he ceases to be or is prohibited from being a Director by law or by virtue of
any provision in the Articles of Association;

(vi)

if he is removed from office by notice in writing served upon him signed by
not less than three-fourths in number (or, if that is not a round number, the
nearest lower round number) of the Directors (including himself) for the time
being then in office; or

(vii) if he shall be removed from office by an ordinary resolution of the members

of the Company under the Articles of Association.

At every annual general meeting of the Company one-third of the Directors for the
time being, or, if their number is not three or a multiple of three, then the number nearest
to, but not less than, one-third, shall retire from office by rotation, provided that every
Director (including those appointed for a specific term) shall be subject to retirement by
rotation at least once every three years. A retiring Director shall retain office until the
close of the meeting at which he retires and shall be eligible for re-election thereat. The
Company at any annual general meeting at which any Directors retire may fill the vacated
office by electing a like number of persons to be Directors.

(i)

Borrowing powers

The Directors may from time to time at their discretion exercise all the powers of
the Company to raise or borrow or to secure the payment of any sum or sums of money
for the purposes of the Company and to mortgage or charge its undertaking, property and
assets (present and future) and uncalled capital or any part thereof.

(j)

Proceedings of the Board

The Directors may meet together for the despatch of business, adjourn and otherwise
regulate their meetings and proceedings as they think fit
in any part of the world.
Questions arising at any meeting shall be determined by a majority of votes. In the case
of an equality of votes, the chairman of the meeting shall have a second or casting vote.

2.3 Alteration to constitutional documents

No alteration or amendment to the Memorandum or Articles of Association may be made

except by special resolution.
