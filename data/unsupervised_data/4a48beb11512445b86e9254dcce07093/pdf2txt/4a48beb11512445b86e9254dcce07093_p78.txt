RISK FACTORS

surrounding the application and interpretation of the Biosimilars Guideline could adversely
affect the regulatory approval of our existing biosimilars drug candidates, which account for
three out of our four core products, as well as any other biosimilars we may develop in the
future. Uncertainties surrounding the approval pathway for biosimilars in China include:

the Biosimilars Guideline is a technical guidance only and cannot address several
fundamental issues for the administration of biosimilars in the absence of a clear
legislative authorization, e.g., the interchangeability with reference products, the
naming rules and the labelling requirements for biosimilars;

although the Biosimilars Guideline adopted a stepwise comparability approach, it
does not contain sufficient details to be regarded as overarching guidelines and it is
also not clear whether the NMPA will take further steps to develop product-specific
guidelines and guidelines addressing issues such as immunogenicity assessment;

while under the Biosimilars Guideline biosimilars are subject to the same approval
pathway as innovative biologics with a set of different technical review criteria, it
remains unclear if the time to market for biosimilars will be reduced compared with
the lengthy review process for innovative biologics; and

impediments

As such, there can be no certainty or assurance that our three Phase 3 biosimilar drug
candidates, namely, IBI-301, IBI-303 and IBI-305, all being our core products, as well as any
other biosimilars we may develop in the future, will be approved under the Biosimilars
Guideline or any further updated policies or guidelines in the future, in a timely manner or at
all, and we may not ultimately be able to develop and market any or all of them successfully.

If safety, efficacy, or other issues arise with any medical product that is used in combination
with our drug candidates, we may be unable to market such drug candidate or may
experience significant regulatory delays or supply shortages, and our business could be
materially harmed.

We plan to develop certain of our drug candidates for use as a combination therapy. If the
NMPA, FDA, EMA or another comparable regulatory agency revokes its approval of another
therapeutic we use in combination with our drug candidates, we will not be able to market our
drug candidates in combination with such revoked therapeutic. If safety or efficacy issues arise
with these or other therapeutics that we seek to combine with our drug candidates in the future,
we may experience significant regulatory delays, and we may be required to redesign or
terminate the applicable clinical trials. In addition, if manufacturing or other issues result in
a supply shortage of any component of our combination drug candidates, we may not be able
to complete clinical development of our drug candidates on our current timeline or at all.
