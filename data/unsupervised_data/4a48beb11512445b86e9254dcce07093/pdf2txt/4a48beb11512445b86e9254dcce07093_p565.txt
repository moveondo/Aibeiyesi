Notes:

(1)

Assuming the Over-allotment Option is not exercised and no Shares are issued pursuant to the Equity Plans.

(2)

(3)

Liu Xiaolin (劉曉琳) formerly served as a senior vice president of research and development.

Chen Shimei (陳石梅) provides consultancy services such as mathematical modeling, clinical development
strategy and product registration strategy and data analysis, scientific publication strategy and product
development consideration, etc to the Company.

the Pre-IPO Share Incentive Plan,

Assuming full exercise of options under

the
shareholding of our Shareholders immediately following the Global Offering will be diluted by
approximately 6.04% if calculated on 1,118,150,710 shares, representing the outstanding
shares in issue immediately after the completion of the Global Offering (assuming the
Over-allotment Option is not exercised and no shares are issued pursuant to the Equity Plans).
The consequent impact on the earnings per ordinary share for the years ended December 31,
2016 and 2017 and the six months ended June 30, 2018 is nil, nil and nil respectively, being
the incremental impact to diluted earnings per share, since the options would not be included
in the calculation of diluted earnings per share due to anti-dilution.
