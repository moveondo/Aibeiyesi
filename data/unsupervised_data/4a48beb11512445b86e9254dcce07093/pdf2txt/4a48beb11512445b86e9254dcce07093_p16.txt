STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS

Eli Lilly has been our strategic partner since the early days of our Company. Our strategic
alliance with Eli Lilly was formalized in 2015 and is comprised of licensing, co-development
and co-branding arrangements in China for sintilimab (IBI-308), our PD-1 antibody, and
IBI-301, our rituximab (MabThera/Rituxan) biosimilar. In addition, we and Eli Lilly have
agreed to collaborate in the discovery, development and commercialization of three PD-1-
based bi-specific antibodies,
these
collaboration agreements demonstrate the quality of our team and its accomplishments. We also
cooperate with other strategic partners, such as Adimab, with whom we have an agreement to
co-discover monoclonal antibodies. We believe we offer a strong value proposition for
potential
technical knowledge, speed,
flexibility and lower cost structure.
