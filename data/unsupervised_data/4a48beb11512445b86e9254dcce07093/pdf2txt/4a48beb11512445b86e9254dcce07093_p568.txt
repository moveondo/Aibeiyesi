the average closing price of the Shares as stated in the daily quotations sheets issued
by the Stock Exchange for the five business days immediately preceding the date of
grant; and

(iii) the nominal value of a Share on the date of grant.

(g) Rights are personal to grantee

An option is personal to the grantee and shall not be transferable or assignable and no
grantee shall in any way sell, transfer, charge, mortgage, encumber or otherwise dispose of or
create any interest in favour of or enter into any agreement with any other person over or in
relation to any option, except for the transmission of an option on the death of the grantee to
his personal representative(s) on the terms of the Post-IPO ESOP.

(h) Options granted to directors or substantial shareholders of the Company

Each grant of options to any director, chief executive or substantial shareholder of our
Company (or any of their respective associates) must first be approved by the independent
non-executive Directors (excluding any independent non-executive Director who is a proposed
recipient of the grant of options).

Where any grant of options to a substantial shareholder or an independent non-executive
Director of our Company (or any of their respective associates) would result in the number of
Shares issued and to be issued upon exercise of all options already granted and to be granted
(including options exercised, cancelled and outstanding) to such person in the 12-month period
up to and including the date of such grant:

(i)

representing in aggregate over 0.1% (or such other higher percentage as may from
time to time be specified by the Stock Exchange) of the Shares in issue; and

(ii) having an aggregate value, based on the closing price of the Shares as stated in the
daily quotations sheets issued by the Stock Exchange on the date of grant, in excess
of HK$5 million (or such other higher amount as may from time to time be specified
by the Stock Exchange),

such further grant of options must also be first approved by the Shareholders (voting by way
of poll) in a general meeting. In obtaining the approval, our Company shall send a circular to
the Shareholders in accordance with and containing such information as is required under the
Listing Rules. The grantee, his associates and all core connected persons of our Company shall
abstain from voting at such general meeting, except that any connected person may vote against
the relevant resolution at the general meeting provided that his intention to do so has been
stated in the circular to be sent to the Shareholders in connection therewith.
