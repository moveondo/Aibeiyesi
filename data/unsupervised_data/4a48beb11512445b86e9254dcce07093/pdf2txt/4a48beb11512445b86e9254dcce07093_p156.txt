Currently, multinational pharmaceutical companies, such as Roche and Novartis, have the
majority share of the market. The domestic mAbs industry is still in its infancy and critically
constrained by the current biologics research and development and manufacturing capabilities.

Chemotherapy is still

the standard of care for cancer, but

targeted therapy and
immunotherapy are being used more broadly and expected to be the preferred treatment option
in the future. Going forward, more efforts will be focused on research and development of
innovative mAbs.

Market Trends and Key Growth Drivers of China’s Biologics Market

According to the Frost & Sullivan Report, the growth of China’s biologics market is

driven by the following key factors:

Increasing Oncology Patient Population and Unmet Demands for Innovative Therapies –
China’s oncology patient population has been increasing at a faster pace compared with the
United States. The incidence of cancer in China is projected to reach 4.8 million in 2022 with
a CAGR of 2.6% from 2017 to 2022, while the incidence of cancer in the United States is
expected to grow only at a CAGR of 0.8% from 2017 to 2022. Also, as shown in the diagram
below, the mortality of all cancers in China is expected to increase at a CAGR of 2.9% from
2.2 million in 2013 to 2.9 million in 2022, outpacing that of both the United States and
globally.
