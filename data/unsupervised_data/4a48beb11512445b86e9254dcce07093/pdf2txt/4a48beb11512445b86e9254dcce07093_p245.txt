Younes et al, Lancet Oncol., 17(9) 1283-94, 2016. “Best overall response was defined as the best
response designation recorded between the date of the first dose and the date of initial objectively
documented progression per the 2007 International Working Group criteria or the date of subsequent
therapy, whichever occurred first.”

Chen et al, JCO., 35(19) 2125-2132, 2017. “ORR was defined as the proportion of patients who achieved
CR or partial response using RRC criteria17 at any time during the study. Best overall response was
defined as best ORR during the period between the first dose and the first documented PD, death, or,
in the absence of PD, last efficacy assessment before subsequent therapy.”

Summary of Registration Trial Results

We have completed a multi-center, single arm, open-label, registration trial in China to
evaluate the efficacy and safety of sintilimab in 96 patients with relapsed/refractory classical
Hodgkin’s lymphoma, which is the largest clinical study in China for this indication. The
primary endpoint is objective response rate (ORR) and the secondary endpoint is complete
response rate (CR). Trial response data was assessed and confirmed by an independent
radiological review committee (IRRC) according to IWG 2007 criteria. Patients were evaluated
by PET after completing a 15-week course of treatment with sintilimab at the dose level of 200
mg every three weeks. As confirmed by the IRRC, for patients in the trial, the best objective
response rate was 79.2% (week 24 data), the best complete response rate was 17.7% (week 15
data), and the disease control rate was 97.9% (week 24 data).
