(4) We also applied the input method in estimating the performance obligations satisfied
under IFRS 15 in relation to the research and development service, which would not
cause a material impact on revenue recognized during the Track Record Period as
compared with IAS 18.

Based on the above, we concluded that there was no significant impact of the early
adoption of IFRS 15, as compared with IAS 18, on our net consolidated financial position and
performance during the Track Record Period, except that the increase of interest expenses and
contract liabilities resulted from the early adoption of IFRS 15 had a significant impact on our
performance for the six months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to our loss and total
comprehensive expenses for the same period.
