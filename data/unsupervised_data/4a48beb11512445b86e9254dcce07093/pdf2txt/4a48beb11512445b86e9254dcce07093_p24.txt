SUMMARY

(ii)

the International Offering of an aggregate of initially 212,715,000 Shares (subject to
adjustment and the Over-allotment Option), (a) in the United States to QIBs in
reliance on Rule 144A or another available exemption; and (b) outside the United
States in reliance on Regulation S (including to professional and institutional
investors in Hong Kong).

The Offer Shares will represent approximately 21.1% of the issued share capital of our
Company immediately following the completion of
the Global Offering, assuming the
Over-allotment Option is not exercised and no shares are issued pursuant to the Equity Plans.
If the Over-allotment Option is exercised in full, and no new Shares will be issued pursuant to
the Equity Plans, and the Offer Shares (including Shares issued pursuant to the full exercise
of the Over-allotment Option) will represent approximately 23.6% of the issued share capital
of our Company immediately following the completion of the Global Offering and the issue of
Offer Shares pursuant to the Over-Allotment Option.
