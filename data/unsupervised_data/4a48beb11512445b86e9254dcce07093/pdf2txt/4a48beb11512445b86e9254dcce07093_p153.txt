Key Therapeutic Areas of Monoclonal Antibodies

Monoclonal antibodies are widely used in different therapeutic areas, including oncology,
auto-immune diseases, neurology and ophthalmology. The global sales revenue of monoclonal
antibodies (including fusion proteins) was US$103.8 billion in 2017. Oncology and auto-
immune diseases are the two largest therapeutic areas of monoclonal antibodies, accounting for
approximately 42.8% and 40.0% of the total monoclonal antibodies market, respectively. The
breakdown of the global mAbs market by therapeutic areas in 2017 is summarized in the
