Early Application of IFRS 9 and IFRS 15

IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments”

IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments” replaces IAS 39 “Financial Instruments” for recognition
and measurement for financial assets and liabilities. The standard is effective for annual
periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018 and earlier application is permitted. We have
elected to early apply IFRS 9, which has been applied consistently in the Track Record Period.

We have assessed the effects of early adoption of IFRS 9 on our financial statements and
concluded that there was no significant impact on our financial position and performance as
compared to the requirements of IAS 39, specifically because:

(1)

(2)

(3)

all our financial assets and financial liabilities would be measured on the same bases
under IFRS 9 and IAS 39;

the application of expected credit loss model under IFRS 9 would not cause a
material impact on the impairment loss allowance for our financial assets measured
at amortized cost during the Track Record Period as compared with the incurred loss
model under IAS 39; and

there are no fair value changes of our financial liabilities which we had designated
as at FVTPL attributable to our credit risk change during the Track Record Period,
and thus the measurement difference for the fair value changes of our financial
liabilities designated as at FVTPL attributable to the credit risk change under IFRS
9 and IAS 39 has no impact on our profit or loss during the Track Record Period.

IFRS 15 “Revenue from contracts with customers”

IFRS 15 “Revenue from contracts with customers” replaces the previous revenue
standards IAS 18 “Revenue” and IAS 11 “Construction Contracts” and related interpretations.
The standard is effective for the first interim period within annual reporting periods beginning
on or after January 1, 2018 and we have early applied IFRS 15 to our financial statements,
which has been applied consistently in the Track Record Period.

We have assessed the effects of the early adoption of IFRS 15 on our financial statements

as compared to the requirements of IAS 18 and summarized as follows:

(1) Advances from customers of RMB292.2 million, RMB349.7 million and RMB443.4
million as of December 31, 2016 and 2017 and June 30, 2018, respectively, under
IAS 18, were classified as contract liabilities under IFRS 15.
