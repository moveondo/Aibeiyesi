INDUSTRY OVERVIEW

OVERVIEW OF THE BIOLOGICS MARKET

Biologics

Biologics are a subset of pharmaceuticals and include a wide range of products such as
monoclonal antibodies, or mAbs, recombinant therapeutic proteins, vaccines, blood and blood
components, cell therapy and gene therapy.

Biologics have benefited from groundbreaking progress in genetics, molecular biology
and biochemistry over the past three decades and are revolutionizing the treatment of diseases
in many major therapeutic areas globally. As a result, the biopharmaceutical industry has
become an increasingly important segment of the pharmaceutical
industry. Advances in
recombinant DNA technologies have facilitated the large-scale manufacturing of biologics
improvements in analytical
products, such as mAbs and fusion proteins.
technologies have enabled improved characterization of biologics which allow for
the
screening and identification of novel biologics with complex structures and various therapeutic
functions.

In addition,

Biologic drugs are currently the top-selling pharmaceutical products in the world. Among
the ten top-selling drugs in 2017, eight are biologics. The total sales revenue of these eight
biologics was US$67.8 billion, accounting for 82.5% of the aggregated sales revenue of the ten
top-selling drugs in 2017.
