APPENDIX III

SUMMARY OF THE CONSTITUTION OF THE
COMPANY AND CAYMAN COMPANIES LAW

(b)

the instrument of transfer is in respect of only one class of shares;

(c)

(d)

the instrument of transfer is properly stamped (in circumstances where stamping is
required);

in the case of a transfer to joint holders, the number of joint holders to whom the
share is to be transferred does not exceed four;

(e)

the shares concerned are free of any lien in favour of the Company; and

(f)

a fee of such amount not exceeding the maximum amount as the Stock Exchange
may from time to time determine to be payable (or such lesser sum as the Directors
may from time to time require) is paid to the Company in respect thereof.

If the Directors refuse to register a transfer of any share they shall, within two months
after the date on which the transfer was lodged with the Company, send to each of the transferor
and the transferee notice of such refusal.

The registration of transfers may, on 10 business days’ notice (or on 6 business days’
notice in the case of a rights issue) being given by advertisement published on the Stock
Exchange’s website, or, subject to the Listing Rules, by electronic communication in the
manner in which notices may be served by the Company by electronic means as provided in
the Articles of Association or by advertisement published in the newspapers, be suspended and
the register of members of the Company closed at such times for such periods as the Directors
may from time to time determine, provided that the registration of transfers shall not be
suspended or the register closed for more than 30 days in any year (or such longer period as
the members of the Company may by ordinary resolution determine provided that such period
shall not be extended beyond 60 days in any year).

2.12 Power of the Company to purchase its own shares

The Company is empowered by the Companies Law and the Articles of Association to
purchase its own shares subject to certain restrictions and the Directors may only exercise this
power on behalf of the Company subject to the authority of its members in general meeting as
to the manner in which they do so and to any applicable requirements imposed from time to
time by the Stock Exchange and the Securities and Futures Commission of Hong Kong. Shares
which have been repurchased will be treated as cancelled upon the repurchase.

2.13 Power of any subsidiary of the Company to own shares

There are no provisions in the Articles of Association relating to the ownership of shares

by a subsidiary.
