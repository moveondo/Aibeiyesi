REGULATIONS

The EIT Law provides that an income tax rate of 10% will normally be applicable to
dividends payable to investors that are “non-resident enterprises”, and gains derived by such
investors, which (a) do not have an establishment or place of business in the PRC or (b) have
an establishment or place of business in the PRC, but the relevant income is not effectively
connected with the establishment or place of business to the extent such dividends and gains
are derived from sources within the PRC. Such income tax on the dividends may be reduced
pursuant to a tax treaty between China and the jurisdictions in which our non-PRC shareholders
reside. Pursuant to an Arrangement Between the Mainland of China and the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal
Evasion With Respect to Tax on Income (《內地和香港特別行政區關於對所得避免雙重徵稅和
防止偷漏稅的安排》) (the “Double Tax Avoidance Arrangement”), and other applicable PRC
laws, if a Hong Kong resident enterprise is determined by the competent PRC tax authority to
have satisfied the relevant conditions and requirements under such Double Tax Avoidance
Arrangement and other applicable laws, the 10% withholding tax on the dividends the Hong
Kong resident enterprise receives from a PRC resident enterprise may be reduced to 5% upon
receiving approval from in-charge tax authority. However, based on the Notice on Certain
Issues with Respect to the Enforcement of Dividend Provisions in Tax Treaties (《關於執行稅
收協定股息條款有關問題的通知》) (the “Notice No. 81”) issued on February 20, 2009 by the
SAT, if the relevant PRC tax authorities determine, in their discretion, that a company benefits
from such reduced income tax rate due to a structure or arrangement
is primarily
tax-driven, such PRC tax authorities may adjust the preferential tax treatment; and based on the
Announcement on Certain Issues with Respect to the “Beneficial Owner” in Tax Treaties (《國
家稅務總局關於稅收協定中“受益所有人”有關問題的公告》) issued on February 3, 2018 and
effective on April 1, 2018, if an applicant’s business activities do not constitute substantive
business activities, it could result in the negative determination of the applicant’s status as a
“beneficial owner” and consequently, the applicant could be precluded from enjoying the
above-mentioned reduced income tax rate of 5% under
the Double Tax Avoidance
Arrangement.
