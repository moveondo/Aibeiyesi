APPENDIX III

SUMMARY OF THE CONSTITUTION OF THE
COMPANY AND CAYMAN COMPANIES LAW

15 Take-overs

Where an offer is made by a company for the shares of another company and, within four
months of the offer, the holders of not less than 90% of the shares which are the subject of the
offer accept, the offeror may at any time within two months after the expiration of the said four
months, by notice require the dissenting shareholders to transfer their shares on the terms of
the offer. A dissenting shareholder may apply to the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands within
one month of the notice objecting to the transfer. The burden is on the dissenting shareholder
to show that the Grand Court should exercise its discretion, which it will be unlikely to do
unless there is evidence of fraud or bad faith or collusion as between the offeror and the holders
of the shares who have accepted the offer as a means of unfairly forcing out minority
shareholders.

16

Indemnification

Cayman Islands law does not limit the extent to which a company’s articles of association
may provide for indemnification of officers and directors, except to the extent any such
provision may be held by the Cayman Islands courts to be contrary to public policy (e.g. for
purporting to provide indemnification against the consequences of committing a crime).

17 Liquidation

A company may be placed in liquidation compulsorily by an order of the court, or
voluntarily (a) by a special resolution of its members if the company is solvent, or (b) by an
ordinary resolution of its members if the company is insolvent. The liquidator’s duties are to
collect the assets of the company (including the amount (if any) due from the contributories
(shareholders)), settle the list of creditors and discharge the company’s liability to them,
rateably if insufficient assets exist to discharge the liabilities in full, and to settle the list of
contributories and divide the surplus assets (if any) amongst them in accordance with the rights
attaching to the shares.

18

Stamp Duty on Transfers

No stamp duty is payable in the Cayman Islands on transfers of shares of Cayman Islands

companies except those which hold interests in land in the Cayman Islands.
