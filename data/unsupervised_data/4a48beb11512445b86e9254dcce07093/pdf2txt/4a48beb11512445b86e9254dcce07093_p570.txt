APPENDIX IV

STATUTORY AND GENERAL INFORMATION

(k) Time of exercise of an option

An option may, subject to the terms and conditions upon which such option is granted, be
exercised in whole or in part by the grantee giving notice in writing to the Company in such
form as the Board may from time to time determine stating that the option is thereby exercised
and the number of Shares in respect of which it is exercised.

(l) Cancellation of options

Any breaches of the rules of the Post-IPO ESOP by a grantee may result in the options
granted to such grantee being cancelled by the Company. Any options granted but not exercised
may be cancelled if the grantee so agrees. Issuance of new options to the same grantee may
only be made if there are unissued options available under the Post-IPO ESOP (excluding the
cancelled options) and in compliance with the terms of the Post-IPO ESOP.

(m) Lapse of option

An option shall lapse automatically (to the extent not already exercised) on the earliest

of:

(i)

the expiry of the period within which an option may be exercised, which is to be
determined and notified by the Board to each grantee at the time of making an offer,
and shall not expire later than ten years from the date of grant (the “Option
Period”);

(ii)

the expiry of any of the periods for exercising the option as referred to in paragraphs
(p), (q) and (r) below; and

(iii) the date on which the grantee commits a breach of the rules of the Post-IPO ESOP.

(n) Voting and dividend rights

No dividends shall be payable and no voting rights shall be exercisable in relation to any

options or Shares that are the subject of options that have not been exercised.

(o) Effects of alterations in the capital structure of the company

In the event of an alteration in the capital structure of the Company whilst any option
remains exercisable by way of capitalisation of profits or reserves, rights issue, subdivision or
consolidation of shares, or reduction of the share capital of the Company in accordance with
legal requirements and requirements of the Stock Exchange (other than any alteration in the
capital structure of the Company as a result of an issue of Shares as consideration in a
transaction to which the Company is a party), such corresponding alterations (if any) shall be
made to:

(i)

the number or nominal amount of Shares comprised in each option so far as
